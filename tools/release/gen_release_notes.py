Please analyze the commits and current CHANGELOG to generate an updated changelog that includes all unreleased changes.

## Input Files:
- Commit log: {commits_file}
- Current CHANGELOG: Use the Read tool to read the CHANGELOG file directly

## Instructions:

1. **Read both files carefully** - The commit log shows all changes since the last release, the CHANGELOG shows what's already documented

2. **Identify unreleased changes** that should be added to the CHANGELOG:
   - Look for commits that represent user-facing changes
   - Focus on new features, bug fixes, performance improvements, breaking changes
   - Skip internal refactoring, CI changes, and minor code cleanup unless they have user impact
   - Group related commits together logically

3. **Follow Perfetto's CHANGELOG format** (based on existing structure):
   - Categories: "Tracing service and probes:", "SQL Standard library:", "Trace Processor:", "UI:", "SDK:", "Tools:", "Docs:"
   - Use bullet points with asterisks (*)
   - Each entry should be concise but descriptive
   - Include technical details but keep accessible to users
   - Use consistent indentation and formatting

4. **Add missing entries** from the unreleased commits:
   - Compare commits against existing CHANGELOG entries
   - Add any significant changes that are missing
   - Maintain logical grouping within categories
   - Ensure no duplicate entries

5. **Output format**:
   - Provide the complete updated CHANGELOG content
   - Keep the existing "Unreleased:" section and enhance it with missing changes
   - Preserve all existing content below the unreleased section
   - Follow the exact formatting style seen in the current CHANGELOG

## Important Notes:
- Focus on changes that affect end users, not internal development
- Maintain the established writing style and technical level
- Use the same terminology and phrasing patterns as existing entries
- Group related commits into single changelog entries where appropriate
- Preserve existing formatting and structure exactly

## Expected Output:
Use the Edit tool to update the CHANGELOG file directly at: CHANGELOG

Update the existing "Unreleased:" section with any missing changes from the commits, maintaining the exact same format and structure as the existing file.

## Example Input (Raw Changelog):
```
Unreleased:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added support for exclusive single-tenant features in ftrace data source.
      These features can only be used by a single tracing session.
    * Added support for tracing_cpumask, tracefs options and ftrace filtering
      by TID as exclusive features.
    * Added support for polling Adreno GPU frequency in SysStatsDataSource.
    * Deprecated: "resolve_process_fds" option in "linux.process_stats" data
      source. Asynchronous scraping is too unreliable and there are no known
      maintainers or users.
  SQL Standard library:
    * Added new power analysis capabilities with expanded Wattson device support
      and IRQ power attribution for more accurate power profiling.
    * Added suspend-aware CPU utilization metrics for better analysis of
      power-managed systems.
    * Added anr_type column to android_anrs table for improved ANR debugging.
    * Added `android.bitmaps` module with timeseries information about bitmap
      usage in Android.
  Trace Processor:
    * Significantly improved performance with optimized data structures and
      MurmurHash implementation, resulting in faster trace loading and query
      execution.
    * Added slice_self_dur table for more efficient self-duration calculations.
    * Added regexp_extract function for improved string processing in queries.
    * Added support for `sibling_merge_behavior` and `sibling_merge_key` in
      `TrackDescriptor` for TrackEvent, allowing for finer-grained control over
      how tracks are merged.
  UI:
    * Added comprehensive dark mode support with theme-aware colors throughout
      the interface.
    * Introduced bulk track settings management allowing users to configure
      multiple tracks simultaneously.
    * Added startup commands feature for automated trace analysis workflows.
    * Fixed numerous crashes and performance issues, including flamegraph
      crashes and selection performance problems.
```

## Example Output (Polished Release Notes):

# Perfetto v52.0 Release Notes

We're excited to announce Perfetto v52.0, packed with significant improvements to the user experience, performance analysis capabilities, and recording infrastructure.

## üåô Comprehensive Dark Mode Support

The Perfetto UI now features a complete dark mode implementation with theme-aware colors throughout the entire interface. This long-requested feature makes it comfortable to analyze traces in low-light environments and provides a modern, professional appearance that many developers prefer.

## üéõÔ∏è Advanced TrackEvent Control & Visualization

SDK users and developers converting external traces to Perfetto format now have fine-grained control over track display and merging behavior. The new `sibling_merge_behavior` and `sibling_merge_key` options in `TrackDescriptor` allow you to:

- Force tracks with the same name to be displayed separately
- Merge tracks with different names into a single UI track
- Override the default name-based merging logic

Additionally, counter tracks can now share Y-axis ranges using the `y_axis_share_key` in `CounterDescriptor`, making it easier to compare related metrics with the same units.

Learn more about [converting custom data to Perfetto format](https://perfetto.dev/docs/getting-started/converting) and [advanced synthetic track event configuration](https://perfetto.dev/docs/reference/synthetic-track-event).

## ‚ö° Trace Processor Performance & New Features

This release delivers significant performance improvements and new analysis capabilities:

- **Faster trace loading**: Optimized data structures and MurmurHash implementation result in noticeably faster trace loading and query execution
- **New analysis tools**: The `slice_self_dur` table provides efficient self-duration calculations, while the `regexp_extract` function enhances string processing in SQL queries

## üì± Enhanced Android Analysis Capabilities

Android developers gain powerful new debugging and performance analysis tools:

- **Better ANR debugging**: The `anr_type` column in the android_anrs table provides more detailed ANR classification
- **Bitmap tracking**: New `android.bitmaps` module offers timeseries information about bitmap usage

## üîß Additional Improvements

- Fixed numerous crashes and performance issues throughout the UI
- Enhanced support for polling Adreno GPU frequency data
