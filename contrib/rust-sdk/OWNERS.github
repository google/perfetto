# This file is intended to define code ownership within the GitHub repository.
# This file should be called OWNERS.github to prevent processing by internal tooling
# that enforces stricter validation on OWNERS files, such as requiring internal
# email domains.
#
# Syntax is the same as .github/CODEOWNERS but paths are relative to this directory.
