# This file is intentionally minimal. Standalone Perfetto builds use bzlmod
# (see MODULE.bazel). This WORKSPACE file exists only for compatibility with
# older Bazel versions that don't support bzlmod.
#
# Embedders who depend on Perfetto via WORKSPACE should use deps.bzl:
#   load("@perfetto//bazel:deps.bzl", "perfetto_deps")
#   perfetto_deps()
