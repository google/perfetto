  //   - for all other properties: the property taken is unspecified and can
  //     be any value provided by one of the source tracks
  //      - examples of other properties include `name`, `child_ordering` etc.
  //      - because of this, it's recommended to ensure that all source tracks

  //     ├── AuthService (smk: "auth_main_cluster")

  //
  // Scenario 1: Merging by `SIBLING_MERGE_BEHAVIOR_BY_SIBLING_MERGE_KEY`
  //   - The first two "AuthService" tracks merge because they share
  //     `smk: "auth_main_cluster"`. Their names are consistent ("AuthService"),
  //     aligning with recommendations. The merged track is named "AuthService".
  //   - The third "AuthService" track (with `smk: "auth_backup_cluster"`)
  //     remains separate, as its `sibling_merge_key` is different.
  //   - "UserProfileService" also remains separate.
  //   - Within the merged "AuthService" (from "auth_main_cluster"):
  //     "LoginOp" get merged as they have the same sibling merge key.
  //
  //   Resulting UI (when merging by SIBLING_MERGE_KEY):
  //     SystemActivity
  //     ├── AuthService (merged by smk: "auth_main_cluster")

  //
  // Scenario 2: Merging by `SIBLING_MERGE_BEHAVIOR_BY_TRACK_NAME`
  //   - All three tracks named "AuthService" merge because they share the same
  //     name. The merged track is named "AuthService". The `sibling_merge_key`
  //     for this merged track would be taken from one of the source tracks
  //     (e.g., "auth_main_cluster" or "auth_backup_cluster"), which could be
  //     relevant if its children had key-based merge behaviors.
  //   - "UserProfileService" remains separate due to its different name.
  //   - Within the single merged "AuthService" track:
  //     "LoginOp", "GuestOp" become siblings. "LoginOp" tracks gets merged as
  //     they have the same name.
  //
  //   Resulting UI (when merging by SIBLING_MERGE_BEHAVIOR_BY_TRACK_NAME):
