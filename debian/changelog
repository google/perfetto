perfetto (9.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Run traced under a dedicated system user account and set socket
    permissions accordingly so that any user can write trace events, but
    only the users in the "traced-consumer" group can read trace data.
  * Update to debhelper 10.
  * Bump version to match Perfetto release.
