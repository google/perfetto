/**
 * TrackManager is responsible for managing the registry of tracks and their
 * lifecycle of tracks over render cycles.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * function render() {
 *   const trackCache = new TrackCache();
 *   const foo = trackCache.getTrackRenderer('foo', 'exampleURI', {});
 *   const bar = trackCache.getTrackRenderer('bar', 'exampleURI', {});
 *   trackCache.flushOldTracks(); // <-- Destroys any unused cached tracks
 * }
 *
 * Example of how flushing works:
 * First cycle
 *   getTrackRenderer('foo', ...) <-- new track 'foo' created
 *   getTrackRenderer('bar', ...) <-- new track 'bar' created
 *   flushTracks()
 * Second cycle
 *   getTrackRenderer('foo', ...) <-- returns cached 'foo' track
 *   flushTracks() <-- 'bar' is destroyed, as it was not resolved this cycle
 * Third cycle
 *   flushTracks() <-- 'foo' is destroyed.

/**
 * Owns all runtime information about a track and manages its lifecycle,
 * ensuring lifecycle hooks are called synchronously and in the correct order.
 *
 * There are quite some subtle properties that this class guarantees:
 * - It make sure that lifecycle methods don't overlap with each other.
 * - It prevents a chain of onCreate > onDestroy > onCreate if the first
 *   onCreate() is still oustanding. This is by virtue of using AsyncLimiter
 *   which under the hoods holds only the most recent task and skips the
 *   intermediate ones.
 * - Ensures that a track never sees two consecutive onCreate, or onDestroy or
 *   an onDestroy without an onCreate.
 * - Ensures that onUpdate never overlaps or follows with onDestroy. This is
 *   particularly important because tracks often drop tables/views onDestroy
 *   and they shouldn't try to fetch more data onUpdate past that point.
