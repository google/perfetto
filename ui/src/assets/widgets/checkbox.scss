// This checkbox element is expected to contain a checkbox type input followed
// by an empty span element.
// The input is completely hidden and an entirely new checkbox is drawn inside
// the span element. This allows us to style it how we like, and also add some
// fancy transitions.
// The box of the checkbox is a fixed sized span element. The tick is also a
// fixed sized rectange rotated 45 degrees with only the bottom and right
// borders visible.
// When unchecked, the tick size and border width is 0, so the tick is
// completely invsible. When we transition to checked, the border size on the
// bottom and right sides is immmdiately set to full width, and the tick morphs
// into view first by expanding along the x axis first, then expanding up the
// y-axis. This has the effect of making the tick look like it's being drawn
// onto the page with a pen.
// When transitioning from checked to unchecked, the animation plays in reverse,
// and the border width is set to 0 right at the end in order to make the tick
// completely invisible again.
