# Perfetto UI

## Quick Start

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/google/perfetto/
$ cd perfetto

# Install build dependencies
tools/install-build-deps --ui

# Will build into ./out/ui by default. Can be changed with --out path/
# The final bundle will be available at ./ui/out/dist/.
# The build script creates a symlink from ./ui/out to $OUT_PATH/ui/.
ui/build

# This will automatically build the UI. There is no need to manually run
# ui/build before running ui/run-dev-server.
ui/run-dev-server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:10000`.
