-- the instrumentation logs begin/end CUJ markers *during* the first frame and
-- typically *right at the start* of the last CUJ frame. The ts boundaries in
-- `android_jank_cuj` table are based on these markers so do not actually
-- contain the whole CUJ, but instead overlap with all Choreographer#doFrame
-- slices that belong to a CUJ.
