# Blaze 8 has an API to specify a glob of dirs to ignore:
# https://bazel.build/versions/8.0.0/rules/lib/globals/repo#ignore_directories.
# But we are using Blaze 7 and so explicitly lists the directories.
#
# We want to exclude all the dirs that contains a BUILD or BUILD.bazel file,
# because Bazel considers such dirs as part of the project, EXEPT for the
# 'buildtools/expat' dir, that is a part of the build and should be kept.
# The following command is used to generate the list:
# $ find buildtools -regex ".*/BUILD\(\.bazel\)?" | \
# xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo "{}" | awk "{ print \$1, \$2 }" FS=/ OFS=/' | \
# uniq | grep -v expat
