Unreleased:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added reporting of TZ offset under system_info.timezone_off_mins .
  Trace Processor:
    *
  UI:
    * Add a new type of debug tracks: counter.
  SDK:
    *


v38.0 - 2023-10-10:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added capability to transfer and clear buffers on CLONE_SNAPSHOT.
    * Added new service for relaying IPC messages from local producers to a
      remote tracing instance.
  Trace Processor:
    * Added new PerfettoSQL syntax (INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE) for including
      tables/views/functions defined in SQL modules.
    * Added new PerfettoSQL syntax (CREATE PERFETTO TABLE) for defining analytic
      tables in SQL.
    * Added new PerfettoSQL syntax (CREATE PERFETTO MACRO) for defining macros
      in SQL.
    * Added TO_REALTIME function to convert timestamps to the realtime clock.
    * Added support for parsing binder_command and binder_return events.
  UI:
    * Added support for zooming when using deep-links.
    * Added track for displaying screenshots in traces.
    * Added support for displaying UTC timestamps.
    * Added capability to list, search and debug plugin tracks.
    * Added plugins with commands for pinning tracks for latency and large
      screen debugging in Android.


v37.0 - 2023-08-10:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Fixed a bug which would cause sessions cloned with CLONE_SNAPSHOT to not
      inherit the trace filtering config.
    * Fixed a bug that would cause flushes to be acked prematurely in
      traced_probes if the android.package_list data source is present.
  SDK:
    * Fix build with MSVC.
  UI:
    * Added command palette (CTRL/Meta+Shift+P).
    * Added grouping of global tracks into groups to reduce visual pollution.
    * Added ability to toggle timestamps between trace / boot / wall time.
    * Added recording UI for callstack sampler.
    * Added "Viz" page to run chart query results with Vega-Lite.
    * Highlight debuggable apps, which might have worse performance
      characteristics, with a chip on the corresponding tracks.
  Misc:
    * master -> main branch migration. HEAD is now main, master is for now a
      mirror and will become a stale frozen snapshot.


v36.1 - 2023-07-06:
  Trace Processor:
    * Fix compile on Windows.


v36.0 - 2023-07-05:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Fixed unnecessary reads of thread files /proc when scraping process names.
  Trace Processor:
    * Rewrote filtering engine to be significantly faster on a wide range of
      common queries.
    * Significantly improved quality of PerfettoSQL error messages.
    * Added API to retrieve last executed statement from iterator.
    * Added support for filtering rows by a regex.
  UI:
    * Fixed flow events working for async tracks.
    * Added table viewer for slice-like tables.
  SDK:
    * Reduce binary size impact of macro and template expansions.


v35.0 - 2023-06-07:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Compression has been moved from perfetto_cmd to traced. Now compression is
      supported even with write_into_file. The `compress_from_cli` config option
      can be used to restore the old behavior.
    * Changed the android.statsd datasource to batch multiple atoms into
      a single trace packet. This improves performance and information
      density.
  Trace Processor:
    * Fixed protozero parsing code to support field ids larger than
      2^16 - 1. protozero now supports field ids up to 1,000,000
      See https://github.com/google/perfetto/issues/510.
  UI:
    * Add support for deep links into the UI via query parameters.
    * Fixed multiple issues around the display of track event log
      messages See https://github.com/google/perfetto/issues/507.


v34.0 - 2023-05-02:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * --continuous-dump in tools/java_heap_dump now keeps recording until it
      receives CTRL+C.
    * Add CLONE_SNAPSHOT triggers for non-destructive snapshots of the trace
      buffer without tracing interruption.
  UI:
    * Add support for parsing large integers from Trace Processor into
      bigint. This is the default behaviour for unknown fields and can
      be enabled specifically via the LONG and LONG_NULL column types.
  SDK:
    * Changed the type of the static constexpr metadata on protozero
      generated bindings from a function returning the metadata to
      metadata itself. For a field 'foo' the variable kFoo previously
      defined as:
      `static constexpr FieldMetadata_Foo kFoo() = { return {}; };`
      it is now defined as:
      `static constexpr FieldMetadata_Foo kFoo;`
      This is a breaking change for users who directly access field
      metadata.
    * The new DataSourceBase::OnFlush() method allows users to properly handle
      Flush requests.


v33.1 - 2023-03-03:
  Identical to v33.0. Version was bumped to work around prebuilt infra failures.


v33.0 - 2023-03-02:
  All:
    * Switched to a C++17-only project by removing C++11 opt-out. This completes
      the migration started in v31.0.
  SDK:
    * Tracing::Initialize() can be called more than once to initialize different
      backends separately.
    * Reduce binary size impact of autogenerated code.


v32.2 - 2023-02-16:
  SDK:
    * Fix MSVC warnings.


v32.1 - 2023-02-01:
  Trace Processor:
    * Fix build on windows.


v32.0 - 2023-02-01:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added an explicit TraceUuid packet. The tracing service now always
      generates a UUID, even if TraceConfig.trace_uuid_msb/lsb is empty.
  Trace Processor:
    *
  UI:
    *
  SDK:
    * Add perfetto::Tracing::ActivateTriggers() function.
    * Made it possible to declare track event categories in a C++ namespace
      with PERFETTO_DEFINE_CATEGORIES_IN_NAMESPACE, allowing multiple category
      sets to be used in one same translation unit. Correspondingly, the
      PERFETTO_COMPONENT_EXPORT and PERFETTO_TRACK_EVENT_NAMESPACE macros have
      been deprecated in favor of this new functionality.
    * Deprecated the PERFETTO_COMPONENT_EXPORT macro in favor of
      PERFETTO_DEFINE_CATEGORIES_IN_NAMESPACE_WITH_ATTRS.
    * Added TracingInitArgs::enable_system_consumer configuration option, that
      allows the linker to discard the consumer IPC, if not required.


v31.0 - 2022-11-10:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added support for collecting Android Trusty ftrace events.
    * Fixed resetting syscall filter when recording selected syscalls.
  Trace Processor:
    * Improved error messages on SQL syntax errors.
    * Improved performance of queries containing GLOB. Handling of GLOB
      constraints now happens inside trace processor instead of SQLite.
    * Added support for parsing Android Trusty ftrace events.
  UI:
    * Added support for metatracing UI code and integrate with trace processor
      metatracing.
    * Added support for scrolling to a time region using the postMessage API.
    * Enabled Pivot table functionality by default.
    * Fixed downloading of Java heap profiles.
  SDK:
    * Switched to require C++17 by default. A time-limited opt-out exists but
      is planned to be removed in v34. Please contact us at
      perfetto-dev@googlegroups.com if you have thoughts or concerns on this
      move.


v30.0 - 2022-10-06:
  Trace Processor:
    * Fixed parsing of "R+" (preempted) and "I" (idle kernel thread) end states
      of sched_switch events, collected on Linux kernels v4.14 and above.
      Previously, preemption was not recognised, and idle was reported as
      "x" (task dead). See commit c60a630cfe0.
    * Add support for parsing sys_write syscalls.
    * Remove the thread_slice table: all columns have moved to the slice table
      and thread_slice exists as a view for backwards compatibility. This view
      will also be removed in the future
    * Add Base64 encode SQL function.
    * Add support for importing function graph ftrace events.
    * Add support for importing V4L2 ftrace events.
    * Add support for importing virtio-video ftrace events.
  UI:
    * Fix downloading profiles from flamegraphs.
    * Enable Pivot table support by default.
  SDK:
    * Add support for disallowing concurrent tracing sessions.


v29.0 - 2022-09-06:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Add support for only tracing selected syscalls. By selecting only syscalls
      of interest, usage of the trace buffer and performance impact on device
      is reduced.
    * Add support for parsing DSI ftrace events.
  Trace Processor:
    * Make calling NotifyEndOfFile more than once an error: this was deprecated
      in v28. Flush should be used instead for all by the final call.
    * Add parsing and ingestion for V4L2 events.
    * Upgraded SQLite to 3.39.2.
  UI:
    * Add support for searching Android log events.
    * Group kernel wakelock tracks into a single track group.
  SDK:
    * Added support for startup tracing. Tracing can be started in an app
      before it connects to the tracing service.
      The data sources which are started for startup tracing, will
      be automatically adopted to normal tracing session once we start
      normal tracing session.
    * Added the |first_packet_on_sequence| boolean which is set the first packet
      emitted on each TraceWriter.


v28.0 - 2022-08-02:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Add android.statsd datasource.
    * Removed log spam about sys.trace.traced_started in standalone builds.
    * Changed kallsyms parsing in traced_probes (ftrace) to be always
      synchronous (when starting the trace, rather than on the first batch).
    * Added ksyms_mem_policy = KSYMS_RETAIN_FOREVER config to avoid destroying
      and re-parsing kallsysm repeatedly in benchmark runs.
    * Improve heap profiling shutdown: now the shared memory buffer where
      alloc/free records are stored is properly flushed when stopping the data
      source.
    * Fixed race condition in the daemonization path of perfetto --background.
      It would cause daemonization failures if the TTY is destroyed immediately.
  Trace Processor:
    * Deprecate calling NotifyEndOfFile more than once: Flush should instead be
      used for all but the final call.
    * Added ingestion and visualization of I2C transactions.
  UI:
    * Changed callstack sampling selection: selecting one sample now only shows
      one stacktrace, selecting multiple samples shows the aggregation.
  SDK:
    * Fixed a bug (b/239725760) that would cause abstract sockets using the
      "@name" syntax in PERFETTO_CONSUMER_SOCK_NAME/PERFETTO_PRODUCER_SOCK_NAME
      to have a trailing \0 in the socket name. This breaks interoperability
      with adb forwarding. This is a tracing protocol breaking change. Nobody
      seems to be relying on @abstract syntax across different versions of
      client vs service.
    * Changed the mangling scheme for protozero enums nested in another message:
      instead of OuterClass_Enum_VALUE, the enum values will be just named
      VALUE with the enum itself wrapped in a perfetto_pbzero_enum_OuterClass
      namespace to prevent naming collisions. This will allow the users
      to alias the enum directly and use throughout their code.
      The exact name mangling scheme is a carry-over from libprotobuf and
      an internal implementation detail, so nobody should be relying on that.
    * Added protozero::EnumToString() to convert enum keys to string literals.


v27.1 - 2022-07-11:
  SDK:
    * Added an API for shutting down Perfetto.


v27.0 - 2022-07-01:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Fix rare crash due to watchdog timeout being too short.
  Trace Processor:
    * Removed enable_perfetto_x64_cpu_opt by default for x64 MacOS
      since it caused issues for CIs.
    * Improved performance of filtering and sorting on most queries.
  UI:
    * Changed sorting of process groups to take slice count and presence of
      perf profiles into account.
  SDK:
    * 


v26.1 - 2022-06-13:
  Trace Processor:
    * Fixed build failures on Windows.


v26.0 - 2022-06-13:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added wildcard (*) support when targeting processes by their command line
      in the Android perf profiler ("linux.perf" data source) and Java heap
      snapshots ("android.java_hprof").
    * Added support for kernel thread sampling, and kernel-only callstacks in
      the Android perf profiler.
    * Fixed rare crash when parsing zero-length ftrace __data_loc strings.
    * Fixed rare crash on 4.19 kernel when encountering unexpected zero-padded
      ftrace pages.
    * Removed capturing of thread_time_in_state (per-UID, per-OOM-adj time).
      The data was unused and subsumed by correlating sched data with power
      rail monitors.
  Trace Processor:
    * Added CREATE_VIEW_FUNCTION operator to define a SQL function that can
      return a temporary table and yield multiple rows and columns.
    * Changed kernel threads to be represented as single-thread processes in
      Linux system traces. The (incorrect) legacy behaviour was to treat them
      as threads of the kthreadd process.
    * Added ABS_TIME_STR function which converts a trace timestamp to
      an ISO8601 string.
    * Added ingestion for phase='R' events, used by performance.{now,mark}().
    * Changed 'trace_to_text' to be named 'traceconv'. The source
      location also moved from 'tools/trace_to_text' to 'src/traceconv'.
    * Changed compiler flags, added -mavx2. The previous patch in v22.0 was
      supposed to add AVX2 support but added only AVX.
    * Changed the handling of the last per-cpu sched slices: rather than
      extending the last event to the end of the trace, the last scheduling
      event has a -1 duration. UIs are supposed to deal with visual extension.
    * Removed android_thread_time_in_state metric. It was an experiment and was
      unused.
    * Removed `instant` table. All instant events are now 0-duration events in
      the `slice` table.
    * Removed the /raw_query REST endpoint from --httpd. This will break very
      old clients that have not switched over the new streaming-based /query
      endoint or even newer /websocket.
  UI:
    * Changed detail panel to separate slice args from generic slice properties.
    * Automatically enabled sched_compact when generating trace configs for 
      Android S+ targets.
  SDK:
    * Added option for recording thread CPU times at the beginning and end of
      each slice.
    * Added perfetto::DynamicString() to use non-literal strings as event names
      in the TRACE_EVENT API.
    * Remove the pre-SDK consumer_api_deprecated interface. It was introduced
      for iorapd, now deleted from the Android tree.


v25.0 - 2022-04-01:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added prebuilts for mac-arm64.
    * Removed merged trace and config protos from Bazel. Embedder should
      instead depend on the non-merged proto targets.
    * Added FtraceConfig.disable_generic_events. If set, the ftrace data source
      will not emit events for which it doesn't have a compile-time proto
      message.
    * Added ingestion support for cros_ec (CrOS sensors) ftrace events.
    * Added ingestion support for kvm trace events.
    * Added reporting of atrace failures. Now they are bubbled up to the UI
      rather than causing atrace data to be silently missing.
  Trace Processor:
    * Added prebuilts for mac-arm64.
    * Changed LIKE comparisions to be case-insenstive. This reverts the change
      introduced in v22. GLOB should be used where case senstive searches are
      desired; built-in metrics continue to require the use of GLOB.
    * Added an optional dependency from trace processor onto a subset of
      sources from llvm-project for function name demangling. Bazel embedders
      might need to update their PERFETTO_CONFIG in perfetto_cfg.bzl to opt in
      or out of the new dependency. See
      perfetto/bazel/standalone/perfetto_cfg.bzl for details.
  UI:
    * Added flow arrows between binder transaction pairs (request/reply
      and async send/async recv).
  SDK:
    * Added support for writing typed proto messages inside DebugAnnotations.
    * Added support for delta encoding of timestamps for TrackEvents.
      To disable it, refer to `disable_incremental_timestamps` flag in
      `track_event_config.proto`.
  Tools:
    * Added support of gzip-compressed traces to traceconv.
    * Changed `traceconv text` to use an internal proto->pbtx converter rather
      than relying on libprotobuf. It could cause some small divergencies in the
      output format vs past releases.
    * Added tools/cpu_profile helper script to capture traces with callstack
      samples.


v24.2 - 2022-02-10:
  SDK:
    * Revert of incremental timestamps, introduced in v24.0.
      Some clients were depending on non-incremental timestamps.
      Future releases will re-enable this but offer an opt-out.


v24.1 - 2022-02-09:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Fixed build failures on Windows.
  Trace Processor:
    * Fixed build failures on Windows.


v24.0 - 2022-02-08:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added "cpufreq_period_ms" in data source "linux.sys_stats" to poll
      /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq periodically.
    * Added support for Trusty TEE workqueue events.
    * Added support for more PMU events in traced_perf.
    * Changed output format of perfetto --query. Made the output more compact
      and added a summary of ongoing tracing sessions for the caller UID.
    * Changed timeout for traced stall detection from 2s to 4s.
    * Changed internal buffer management to split trace filtering in smaller
      tasks and avoid too large memory allocation when filtering.
    * Fixed a bug that could cause producers to see Flush() requests after an
      OnStop() and mis-behave if the tracing session is extremely short.
  Trace Processor:
    * Added support for passing multiple SQL statements to ExecuteQuery(). All
      queries will be executed fully, with the returned iterator yielding rows
      for the final statement.
    * Added support for multi-line SQL comments; previously only single line
      comments were supported.
  UI:
    * Added support for parsing instant events from legacy systrace formats.
    * Added ingestion and visualization for inet_sock_set_state and
      tcp_retransmit_skb events, showing TCP connections on dedicated tracks.
    * Changed HTTP+RPC to use the /websocket endpoint available in newer
      versions of trace_processor --httpd.
    * Changed text selection/copy: now allowed by default for DOM elements.
    * Changed search to also lookup slices by ID when the term is a number.
    * Changed postMessage() API, suppressed confirmation dialog when the opener
      is in the same origin, for cases when the UI is self-hosted.
  SDK:
    * Changed timestamps emitted by the SDK to be incremental by default, using
      ClockSnapshot + TracePacketDefaults.


v23.0 - 2022-01-11:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added workaround for a kernel ftrace bug causing some "comm" fields to be
      not null-terminated. https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/f0a5157803 .
    * Added ability to talk to the newer AIDL-based health hal in traced_probes.
      It still falls back on the older HIDL interface for older devices.
  Trace Processor:
    * Changed the argument for the trace path in constructor of TraceProcessor
      in the Python API from |file_path| to |trace|.
      |file_path| is deprecated and may be removed in the future.
    * Changed the Python API constructor. Now it takes a TraceProcessorConfig
      instead of passing parameters directly. This may break existing code
      but migration should be trivial (all current options are still
      supported).
    * Fixed a HTTP keepalive bug in trace_processor --httpd. The bug, introduced
      in v22.0, caused each RPC request to close the connection, effectively
      defeating the 'Connection: Keep-Alive', after each query made by the UI.
    * Added parsing of netif_receive_skb events from proto traces.
    * Added android_netperf metric based on netif events.
    * Fixed a bug that would cause fetch errors when loading traces > 32 MB when
      using trace_processor --httpd.
    * Added a workaround to tokenize properly /proc/pid/cmdline for chrome
      processes on Linux/CrOS. Chrome rewrites its cmdline replacing \0 -> ' '.
  UI:
    *
  SDK:
    *


v22.1 - 2021-12-07:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added workaround for a Linux kernel bug causing some ftrace strings to
      be non-null-terminated (https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/f0a5157).
  Trace Processor:
    * Fixed build failures on Windows.


v22.0 - 2021-12-03:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added Android SDK version to the SystemInfo trace packet.
    * Changed compiler flags. Assume recent x64 CPUs (-msse4.2 -mavx -mpopcnt).
      This behavior affects only standalone builds and can be changed by setting
      enable_perfetto_x64_cpu_opt=false in the GN args.
    * The java heap profiler now rescans all the processes every time for
      continous_dump_config. The scan_pids_only_on_start can be used to restore
      the old behavior.
    * Added support for building on ARM Macs.
    * Added support for the rss_stat_throttled event on Android via
      FtraceConfig.throttle_rss_stat. In newer Android kernels the base rss_stat
      event is now unthrottled. rss_stat used to be throttled by a downstream
      kernel change, unnecessary after https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/10/25/1411 .
      atrace.rc configures throttling from userspace at boot.
    * Fixed a bug that caused IPCs to stall traced and hit the watchdog if in
      the middle of a suspend/resume. Switched from SND_TIMEO to poll(POLLOUT).
    * Added "linux.sysfs_power" data source to poll /sys/class/power_supply/
      and report periodically battery charge and drain rate if supported.
    * Add snapshotting for non-BOOTTIME ftrace clocks. This fixes handling of
      ftrace events from old Linux kernel versions (i.e. 3.x) and adds
      proper support for using the "global" clock rather than "boot".
  Trace Processor:
    * Speeded up proto trace ingestion by 2x (~20 MB/s -> ~40 MB/s).
    * Changed LIKE comparisions to be case-senstive. This may break existing
      queries but was a necessary from a performance perspective.
      Going forward, GLOB must be used, instead of LIKE, for checked in metrics
      to avoid unnecessary slowdowns.
    * Changed compiler flags, assume recent x64 CPUs (see above).
    * Changed how displayTimeUnit is handled in JSON traces to match catapult.
    * Added websocket endpoint to RPC interface to reduce query latency.
    * Added support for hot-reloading metrics (see //docs/analysis/metrics.md).
    * Added ingestion support for non-BOOTTIME ftrace clocks.
  UI:
    * Added ability to save/restore record config. Remember last used config.
    * Fixed bug causing the recording page to hold onto the USB interface making
      adb unusable after a recording session.
  SDK:
    * Added UpdateDataSource() descriptor IPC endpoint to allow updates of the
      data source capabilities (e.g., category list for track event).


v21.0 - 2021-11-01:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added reporting of last 8 PERFETTO_LOG() entries and crash keys to
      crash tombstones on Android.
    * Changed kallsym parser to save 100ms for starting a tracing session with
      enable_ksyms=true.
    * Removed advertisement of the built-in data sources "android.heapprofd",
      "android.java_hprof", "linux.perf" on Linux and other platforms. Built-in
      data sources are only used to lazy-start daemons on Android OS.
    * Changed ACL files on Android atrace.rc to support to up to 24 ftrace cpus.
      No change on Linux which remains unlimited.
  Trace Processor:
    * Changed protobuf decoders to use less stack and fall back on heap sooner
      (before: 16KB of stack per decoder, after: 1.6KB). It caused problems with
      some embedders which use smaller per-thread stacks.
    * Added support for SPAN OUTER JOIN on unpartitioned tables.
    * Improved performance of as_pandas_dataframe() in the Python API by 16x.
  UI:
    * Added visualization of direct_reclaim ftrace events.
  SDK:
    * Added perfetto::{Flow,TerminatingFlow} to the track-event library.


v20.1 - 2021-10-05:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Fixed standalone Windows build. Updated the llvm-win toolchain.


v20.0 - 2021-10-03:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Removed DCHECK that would cause crashes when a debug build of the service
      is used with a producer built with -DNDEBUG.
    * Changed the service-side field-level filtering configuration protobuf
      field number, because the feature had a bug. This is effectively
      equivalent to deprecating the feature and reintroducing it under a
      different name.
    * Added support for boot tracing on Android. Early kernel tracing (prior to
      the point when /data is mounted) is not yet supported. For instructions
      see /docs/case-studies/android-boot-tracing.md .
  Trace Processor:
    * Added reqiurement of separating queries by semi-colon (;) followed by
      new-line when specifying a query file with -q to trace processor shell.
    * Added "ancestor_slice_by_stack" and "descendant_slice_by_stack" table
      functions to walk up and down the slice stacks.
    * Overhauled windowed sorting to be based on packet ordering and
      lifecycle events inside the trace instead of time-based ordering.
    * Removed |SortingMode::kForceFlushPeriodWindowedSort| due to changes to the
      sorting algorithm, which is now based on Flush events rather than time.
      Embedders should switch to |SortingMode::kDefaultHeuristics|. Other
      SortingMode enum values are no-ops and will be removed in future versions.
  UI:
    * Added initial flamegraph support for traced_perf callstack samples.
    * Added initial Pivot table for aggregation of userspace slices. The feature
      is disabled by default for and requires manual enabling via

      were numbered as like v19.0.42 where 42 represented the number of commits
      since the last major version release. This was ambiguous in the presence
      of branches. Now versions are numbered like v19.0-ab12cd34 where ab12cd34
      is the shortened Git commit-ish.


v18.0 - 2021-08-02:
  Tracing service and probes:

      (RINGBUF_TYPE_TIME_STAMP), encountered on Linux kernels 5.9+.
    * Fixed a bug in --save-for-bugreport causing 0-length traces if the
      selected trace declared one or more triggers in the config.
    * Fixed a bug in tracebox causing the PERFETTO_PRODUCER_SOCK_NAME env
      var to be ignored.
  Trace Processor:
    * Changed CORS headers of --httpd mode to allow only https://ui.perfetto.dev
      and http://localhost:10000. This affects only CORS-aware browser clients.

  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added support for building most targets (including traced, SDK and
      trace_processor_shell) from Windows using either clang-cl or MSVC 2019.
    * Added tracebox, a monolithic binary to capture traces with one command
      on Linux and older versions of Android (tested on Android Oreo).
    * Added support for service-side field-level filtering of traces. The
      consumer can pass a filter bytecode and ensure that non-allowed fields
      are never emitted in output.
    * Added reporting of service version and producer SDK version into the trace
      and `perfetto --query`.
    * Fixed compatibility with Android versions older than Pie (for sideloading)
      which cause failures when trying to enable atrace categories.
  Trace Processor:
    * Added new RPC interface based on a bidirectional binary pipe. This allows
      to simplify integration with out-of-process users. The existing --httpd

      as async slices (datasource: already existing ftrace dmabuf event).
    * Fixed visualization of unfinished slices to extend to the end of the
      viewport.
  SDK:
    * Added support for passing arbitrary number of debug annotations to
      TRACE_EVENT and combining them with lambdas.

      the Android startup metric.
    * Added chrome metadata key/value pairs (e.g. chrome version) into the
      `metadata` table with 'cr-' prefixed keys.
    * Added dma-buf-based memory metrics reporting total/avg/min/max dmabuf
      allocation per-dmabuf-heap and per-process.
    * Removed |force_full_sort| flag from config. This has been replaced
      by setting the sorting mode to force a full sort.
  UI:
    * Added tools/symbolize-ui-crash script to resolve crash reports via
      TypeScript source maps.
    * Fixed newlines when copying Android event log lines into the clipboard.
    * Fixed crash when selecting "Did not finish" slices.

      a dedicated tracing instance in $tracefs/instances/mm_events.
  Trace Processor:
    * Added sorting mode to trace processor config to specify how trace
      processor should sort events. The |force_full_sort| flag has been
      deprecated (with replacement) and will be removed in the next version.
    * Added ingestion of frame timeline events into the
      {expected,actual}_frame_timeline_slice tables.
