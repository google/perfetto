    # args from different events (e.g. begin / end pair). This was working most
    # of the time (as the key are processed in sorted order and interned ids are
    # incremental).

    # This test, however, is crafted to trigger the bug by ensuring that some
    # keys are seens first (due to being seen in a different event, and therefore
    # being already interned and therefore having a lower interned id.
