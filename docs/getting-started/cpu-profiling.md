# Recording performance counters and CPU profiling with Perfetto

In this guide, you'll learn how to:

- Record CPU profiles and performance counters with Perfetto.
- Collect callstack profiles to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Visualize and analyze CPU profiles in the Perfetto UI.

On linux and android, perfetto can record per-cpu
[perf counters](https://perfwiki.github.io/main/), for example hardware events
such as executed instructions or cache misses. Additionally, perfetto can be
configured to sample callstacks of running processes based on these performance
counters. Both modes are analogous to the `perf record` command from the perf
tool, and use the same system call (`perf_event_open`).

If you're only interested in the profiling (i.e. flamegraphs), skip to
["Collecting a callstack profile"](#collecting-a-callstack-profile).

## Collecting a trace with perf counters

The recording is defined using the usual perfetto config protobuf, and can be
freely combined with other data sources such as ftrace. This allows for hybrid
traces with a single timeline showing both the sampled counter values as well as
other traced data, e.g. process scheduling.

The data source configuration
([PerfEventConfig](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/perfetto/protos/perfetto/config/profiling/perf_event_config.proto?q=PerfEventConfig))
defines the following:

- **[Timebase](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/perfetto/protos/perfetto/common/perf_events.proto?q=Timebase)
  (or group leader)**: The primary event being counted. This event is counted
  separately on each CPU.
- **Sampling period/frequency**: How often the counter is sampled. This can be a
  fixed `period` (e.g., every 1000 events) or a `frequency` (e.g., 100 times per
  second).
- **[Followers](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/perfetto/protos/perfetto/common/perf_events.proto?q=FollowerEvent)**:
  Any additional counters to record. These counters are snapshotted at the same
  time as the timebase event.

One tracing configuration can define multiple "linux.perf" data sources for
separate sampling groups. But note that you need to be careful not to exceed the
PMU capacity of the platform if counting hardware events. Otherwise the kernel
will multiplex (repeatedly switch in and out) the event groups, leading to
undercounting (see
[this perfwiki page](https://perfwiki.github.io/main/tutorial/#multiplexing-and-scaling-events)
for more info).

### Example config

This config defines one group of three counters per CPU. A timer event
(`SW_CPU_CLOCK`) is used as the leader, providing a steady rate of samples. Each
sample additionally includes the counts of cpu cycles (`HW_CPU_CYCLES`) and
executed instructions (`HW_INSTRUCTIONS`) since the beginning of tracing.

```protobuf
duration_ms: 10000

buffers: {
  size_kb: 40960
  fill_policy: DISCARD
}

# sample per-cpu counts of instructions and cycles
data_sources {
  config {
    name: "linux.perf"
    perf_event_config {
      timebase {
        frequency: 1000
        counter: SW_CPU_CLOCK
        timestamp_clock: PERF_CLOCK_MONOTONIC
      }
      followers { counter: HW_CPU_CYCLES }
      followers { counter: HW_INSTRUCTIONS }
    }
  }
}

# include scheduling data via ftrace
data_sources: {
  config: {
    name: "linux.ftrace"
    ftrace_config: {
      ftrace_events: "sched/sched_switch"
      ftrace_events: "sched/sched_waking"
    }
  }
}

# include process names and grouping via procfs
data_sources: {
  config: {
    name: "linux.process_stats"
    process_stats_config {
      scan_all_processes_on_start: true
    }
  }
}
```

Which should look similar to the following in the UI, after expanding the
"Hardware" -> "Perf Counters" track groups. The counter tracks show the values
as counting rates by default.

![Perf counter trace in the UI](/docs/images/perf-counter-ui.png)

The counter data can be queried as follows:

```sql
select ts, cpu, name, value
from counter c join perf_counter_track pct on (c.track_id = pct.id)
order by 1, 2 asc
```

### Recording instructions

<?tabs>

TAB: Android (command line)

Prerequisites:
- [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) installed on the
  host machine.
- A device running Android 15+, connected to the host machine using USB with
  ADB authorised.

Download the `tools/record_android_trace` python script from the perfetto repo.
The script automates pushing the config to the device, invoking perfetto,
pulling the written trace from the device, and opening it in the UI.
```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/perfetto/main/tools/record_android_trace
```

Assuming the example config above is saved as `/tmp/config.txtpb`, start the
recording:
```bash
python3 record_android_trace -c /tmp/config.txtpb -o /tmp/trace.pb
```

The recording will stop after 10 seconds (as set by duration\_ms in the config),
and can be stopped early by pressing ctrl-c. After stopping, the script should
auto-open the perfetto UI with the trace.


TAB: Linux (command line)

Download (or build from sources) the `tracebox` binary, which packages together
the recording implementation of most perfetto data sources.
```bash
curl -LO https://get.perfetto.dev/tracebox
chmod +x tracebox
```

Change the Linux permissions for ftrace and perf event recording. The following
may be sufficient depending on your particular distribution:
```bash
sudo chown -R $USER /sys/kernel/tracing
echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
```

**Alternatively**, run `tracebox` as root (using sudo) in the subsequent step.

Assuming the example config above is saved as `/tmp/config.txtpb`, start the
recording.
```bash
./tracebox -c /tmp/config.txtpb --txt -o /tmp/trace.pb
```

Open the `/tmp/trace.pb` file in the [Perfetto UI](https://ui.perfetto.dev).

## Collecting a callstack profile

The counter recording can also be configured to include a callstack (list of
function frames that called each other) of the process that was interrupted at
the time of the counter sampling. This is achieved by asking the kernel to
record additional state (userspace register state, top of the stack memory) in
each sample, and unwinding + symbolising the callstack in the profiler. The
unwinding happens outside of the process, without any need for instrumentation
or injected libraries in the processes being profiled.

To enable callstack profiling, set the
[`callstack_sampling`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/perfetto/protos/perfetto/config/profiling/perf_event_config.proto?q=%22optional%20CallstackSampling%20callstack_sampling%20%3D%2016;%22)
field in the data source config. Note that the sampling will still be performed
per-cpu, but you can set the
[`scope`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/perfetto/protos/perfetto/config/profiling/perf_event_config.proto?q=%22optional%20Scope%20scope%20%3D%201;%22)
field to have the profiler unwind callstacks only for matching processes (which
in turn can help prevent the profiler from being overloaded by unwinding runtime
costs).

### Example config

The following is an example of a config for periodic sampling based on time
(i.e. a per-cpu timer leader), unwinding callstacks only if they happen when a
process with the given name is running.

By changing the `timebase`, you can instead capture callstacks on other events,
for example you could see the callstacks of when the process wakes other threads
up by setting "sched/sched_waking" as a `tracepoint` timebase.

Android note: the example uses "com.android.settings" as an example, but for
successful callstack sampling the app has to be declared as either
[profileable or debuggable](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/profileable-element)
in the manifest (or you must be on a debuggable build of the android OS).

```protobuf
duration_ms: 10000

buffers: {
  size_kb: 40960
  fill_policy: DISCARD
}

# periodic sampling per cpu, unwinding callstacks if
# "com.android.settings" is running.
data_sources {
  config {
    name: "linux.perf"
    perf_event_config {
      timebase {
        counter: SW_CPU_CLOCK
        frequency: 100
        timestamp_clock: PERF_CLOCK_MONOTONIC
      }
      callstack_sampling {
        scope {
          target_cmdline: "com.android.settings"
        }
        kernel_frames: true
      }
    }
  }
}

# include scheduling data via ftrace
data_sources: {
  config: {
    name: "linux.ftrace"
    ftrace_config: {
      ftrace_events: "sched/sched_switch"
      ftrace_events: "sched/sched_waking"
    }
  }
}

# include process names and grouping via procfs
data_sources: {
  config: {
    name: "linux.process_stats"
    process_stats_config {
      scan_all_processes_on_start: true
    }
  }
}
```

### Recording instructions

<?tabs>

TAB: Android (command line)

Prerequisites:
- [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) installed on the
  host machine.
- A device running Android 15+, connected to the host machine using USB with
  ADB authorised.
- A [_Profileable_ or _Debuggable_](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/benchmarking/macrobenchmark-instrumentation#profileable-apps)
  app. If you are running on a "user" build of Android (as opposed to
  "userdebug" or "eng"), your app needs to be marked as profileable or
  debuggable in its manifest.

For android, the `tools/cpu_profile` helper python script simplifies
construction of the trace config, and has additional options for
post-symbolisation of the profile (in case of libraries without symbol info)
and conversion to the [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) format that is
better suited for pure flamegraph visualisations. It can be downloaded as
follows:
```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/perfetto/main/tools/cpu_profile
```

Start the recording using periodic sampling based on time (i.e. a per-cpu timer
leader), unwinding callstacks only if they happen when a process with the given
name is running. Note that non-native callstacks can be expensive to unwind, so
we recommend keeping the sampling frequency below 200 Hz per cpu.
```bash
python3 cpu_profile -n com.android.example -f 100
```

The recording can be stopped by pressing ctrl-c. The script will then print a
path under /tmp/ where it placed the outputs, the `raw-trace` file in that
directory can be opened in the [Perfetto UI](https://ui.perfetto.dev), while
the `profile.*.pb` are the per-process aggregate profiles in the "pprof" file
format.

See `cpu_profile --help` for more flags, notably `-c` lets you supply your own
textproto config, while taking advantage of the scripted recording and
output conversion.

#### Missing symbols and deobfuscation

If your profiles are missing native libraries' function names, but you have
access to the debug version of the libraries (with symbol data), you can
instruct the `cpu_profile` script to symbolise the profile on the host by
following [these
instructions](/docs/data-sources/native-heap-profiler#symbolization), while
substituting the script name.


TAB: Linux (command line)

Download (or build from sources) the `tracebox` binary, which packages together
the recording implementation of most perfetto data sources.
```bash
curl -LO https://get.perfetto.dev/tracebox
chmod +x tracebox
```

Change the Linux permissions for ftrace and perf event recording. The following
may or may not be enough depending on your particular distribution (note the
added kptr\_restrict override if you want to see kernel function names).
```bash
sudo chown -R $USER /sys/kernel/tracing
echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
echo 0  | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
```

**Alternatively**, run `tracebox` as root (using sudo) in the subsequent step.

Assuming the example config above is saved as `/tmp/config.txtpb` (with the
target\_cmdline option changed to a process on your machine), start the
recording.
```bash
./tracebox -c /tmp/config.txtpb --txt -o /tmp/trace.pb
```

Once the recording stops, open the `/tmp/trace.pb` file in the [Perfetto
UI](https://ui.perfetto.dev).

To convert the trace into per-process profiles in the "pprof" format, you can
use the `traceconv` script as follows:

```bash
python3 traceconv profile --perf /tmp/trace.pb
```

#### Missing symbols and deobfuscation

If your profiles are missing native libraries' function names, but you have
access to the debug version of the libraries (with symbol data), you can
symbolise the profile after the fact by following [these
instructions](/docs/data-sources/native-heap-profiler#symbolization), skipping
the heap profiling script and instead using the `traceconv symbolize` script
command directly.

### Visualising the profiles in the Perfetto UI

In the UI, the callstack samples will be shown as instant events on the
timeline, within the process track group of the sampled process. There is a
track per sampled thread, as well as a single track combining all samples from
that process. By selecting time regions with perf samples, the bottom pane will
show dynamic flamegraph views of the selected callstacks.

![callstack profile in the UI](/docs/images/perf-callstack-ui.png)

The sample data can also be queried from the
[`perf_sample`](/docs/analysis/sql-tables.autogen#perf_sample) table via SQL.

### Querying traces

As well as visualizing traces on a timeline, Perfetto has support for querying
traces using SQL. The easiest way to do this is using the query engine available
directly in the UI.

1.  In the Perfetto UI, click on the "Query (SQL)" tab in the left-hand menu.

    ![Perfetto UI Query SQL](/docs/images/perfetto-ui-query-sql.png)

2.  This will open a two-part window. You can write your PerfettoSQL query in
    the top section and view the results in the bottom section.

    ![Perfetto UI SQL Window](/docs/images/perfetto-ui-sql-window.png)

3.  You can then execute queries Ctrl/Cmd + Enter:

For example, by running:

```
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE linux.perf.samples;

SELECT
  -- The id of the callstack. A callstack in this context
  -- is a unique set of frames up to the root.
  id,
  -- The id of the parent callstack for this callstack.
  parent_id,
  -- The function name of the frame for this callstack.
  name,
  -- The name of the mapping containing the frame. This
  -- can be a native binary, library, JAR or APK.
  mapping_name,
  -- The name of the file containing the function.
  source_file,
  -- The line number in the file the function is located at.
  line_number,
  -- The number of samples with this function as the leaf
  -- frame.
  self_count,
  -- The number of samples with this function appearing
  -- anywhere on the callstack.
  cumulative_count
FROM linux_perf_samples_summary_tree;
```

you can see the summary tree of all the callstacks captured in the trace.

### Alternatives

The perfetto profiling implementation is built for continuous (streaming)
collection, and is therefore less optimised for short, high-frequency profiling.
If all you need are aggregated flamegraphs, consider `simpleperf` on Android and
`perf` on Linux. These tools are more mature and have a simpler user interface
for this use case.
