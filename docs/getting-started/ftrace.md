# Instrumenting the Linux kernel with ftrace

In this guide, you'll learn how to:
- Instrument your kernel code using ftrace events.
- Record ftrace events using `tracebox`.
- Interpret ftrace events into tracks in `trace_processor`.
- View the raw events and the interpreted tracks in the Perfetto UI.

This guide is intended for **kernel and systems developers** who want to add
custom instrumentation to the Linux kernel and integrate it with perfetto.

People tinkering with a local kernel and wanting simple track visualisations
without touching perfetto code can skim [Part C][section-c-link] instead.

## Introduction

[Ftrace][ftrace-link] is a configurable tracing framework built into the Linux
kernel. It allows developers to instrument the kernel with tracepoints and
probes that can be dynamically enabled to record events at runtime (for example,
a context switch from one thread to another on a given cpu). The userspace
configures what to record, and reads the resulting traces via the `tracefs`
filesystem, typically mounted at `/sys/kernel/tracing`. The kernel comes
pre-instrumented with hundreds of tracepoints that can be used to understand
scheduling, memory, and other subsystems.

Perfetto can be [configured][cfg-link] to record a set of ftrace events as part
of a perfetto trace. The system recording implementation (built into
traced\_probes or tracebox) configures the tracefs and converts the resulting
event stream into perfetto's protobuf trace format.

The query engine and UI in turn have domain-specific parsing of ftrace events.
For example raw context switch and wakeup events are turned into per-cpu and
per-thread scheduling tracks in the UI, backed by queryable SQL tables.

TIP: if you simply want to visualise the execution of kernel functions, perfetto
has built-in visualisation for the `function_graph` tracer built into ftrace,
which does not require any additional instrumentation. See [these config
options][funcgraph-cfg-link] for more details.

This page is split into three sections:
- [Part A][section-a-link]: covers creating an example kernel module with a
  static tracepoint, recording the events with perfetto, and viewing the basic
  event data in the perfetto UI.
- [Part B][section-b-link] (advanced): covers adding dedicated parsing for the
  tracepoint by modifying perfetto sources. This lets you take full
  advantage of turning your events into structured SQL tables and UI tracks.
- [Part C][section-c-link]: as an alternative to the above, describes a
  convention for structuring tracepoints so that perfetto can automatically turn
  them into slices/instants/counters **without modifying perfetto sources**.

## Part A: Instrumenting the kernel and recording tracepoints

### Create the kernel module source files

For this example we are going to create a kernel module called `ticker` which
contains a tracepoint called `ticker_tick` which is called every second with an
incrementing counter as the argument.

Create a new directory and copy the following file contents into the following
directory structure:

```
.
├── Makefile
├── ticker.c
└── trace
    └── events
        └── ticker.h
```

The main source:

```c
// ticker.c

#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/timer.h>
#include <linux/version.h>

#define CREATE_TRACE_POINTS
#include "trace/events/ticker.h"

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_AUTHOR("Perfetto");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("Ticker: A kernel module emitting example static tracepoint events.");
MODULE_VERSION("0.1");

static struct timer_list my_timer;
static unsigned int tick_count = 0;
static unsigned long timer_interval_ms = 1000;

static void my_timer_callback(struct timer_list *timer)
{
    // Fire the tracepoint, incrementing the tick count every time.
    // The function name is trace_<event_name> from the header file.
    trace_ticker_tick(tick_count++);

    // Re-arm the timer.
    mod_timer(&my_timer, jiffies + msecs_to_jiffies(timer_interval_ms));
}

static int __init ticker_init(void)
{
    pr_info("Ticker: Initializing...\n");

    timer_setup(&my_timer, my_timer_callback, 0);
    mod_timer(&my_timer, jiffies + msecs_to_jiffies(timer_interval_ms));

    pr_info("Ticker: Timer started.\n");
    pr_info("Ticker: View events under /sys/kernel/tracing/events/ticker/\n");

    return 0;
}

static void __exit ticker_exit(void)
{
    pr_info("Ticker: Exiting...\n");

#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(6, 15, 0)
    timer_delete_sync(&my_timer);
#else
    del_timer_sync(&my_timer);
#endif

    pr_info("Ticker: Timer stopped and module unloaded.\n");
}

module_init(ticker_init);
module_exit(ticker_exit);
```

The header defining the tracepoints. Note that it is important for the header to
be under `trace/events/` and not at the root of the directory. Otherwise the
kernel macros won't expand correctly:

```h
// trace/events/ticker.h

#undef TRACE_SYSTEM
#define TRACE_SYSTEM ticker

#if !defined(_TRACE_TICKER_H_) || defined(TRACE_HEADER_MULTI_READ)
#define _TRACE_TICKER_H_

#include <linux/tracepoint.h>

TRACE_EVENT(ticker_tick,

    TP_PROTO(unsigned int count),

    TP_ARGS(count),

    TP_STRUCT__entry(
        __field(unsigned int, count)
    ),

    TP_fast_assign(
        __entry->count = count;
    ),

    TP_printk("count=%u",
        __entry->count
    )
);

#endif /* _TRACE_TICKER_H_ */

/* This part must be outside protection */
#include <trace/define_trace.h>
```

Finally, the makefile for building the module:

```makefile
# Makefile

obj-m += ticker.o
ccflags-y += -I$(src)
KDIR ?= /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build
PWD := $(shell pwd)

all:
	$(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) M=$(PWD) modules

clean:
	$(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) M=$(PWD) clean

.PHONY: all clean
```

### Build and load the module

Make sure your kernel headers are installed and run `make` to build the kernel
module.

You can now install the kernel module with:
```bash
sudo insmod ticker.ko
```

Note: You can always uninstall the kernel module with:
```bash
sudo rmmod ticker.ko
```

### (optional) Manually verify the tracepoint

We can manually verify the tracepoint by using the `tracefs` file system to view
the textual representation of the event.

First, confirm that the event is present in tracefs:
```bash
ls /sys/kernel/tracing/events/ticker/ticker_tick
```

Enable our ticker event and tracing in general:
```bash
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/tracing/events/ticker/ticker_tick/enable
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/tracing/tracing_on
```

Listen to the stream of ftrace events with:
```bash
sudo cat /sys/kernel/tracing/trace_pipe
```

You should see the ticker events being emitted roughly every second, with an
incrementing "count" field. The textual event representation is printed using
the `TP_printk(...)` part of the tracepoint definition above.

```
# cat /sys/kernel/tracing/trace_pipe
          <idle>-0       [011] ..s1. 850584.176058: ticker_tick: count=38
          <idle>-0       [011] ..s1. 850585.200042: ticker_tick: count=39
           <...>-2904431 [015] ..s1. 850586.224031: ticker_tick: count=40
          puppet-2904431 [015] ..s.. 850587.248080: ticker_tick: count=41
          <idle>-0       [011] ..s1. 850588.272137: ticker_tick: count=42
          <idle>-0       [011] ..s1. 850589.296040: ticker_tick: count=43
          <idle>-0       [011] ..s1. 850590.320049: ticker_tick: count=44
          <idle>-0       [011] ..s1. 850591.344048: ticker_tick: count=45
          <idle>-0       [011] ..s1. 850592.372038: ticker_tick: count=46
          <idle>-0       [011] ..s1. 850593.392033: ticker_tick: count=47
          <idle>-0       [003] ..s1. 850594.416049: ticker_tick: count=48
          <idle>-0       [011] ..s1. 850595.440054: ticker_tick: count=49
```

### Record a perfetto trace with tracebox

In order to record our ticker events, we are going to record a system trace
using `tracebox`. First we need to create a recording config file that's
configured to do so:

```
# ticker.cfg

buffers {
  size_kb: 20480
  fill_policy: DISCARD
}

# Record our ticker events only.
data_sources {
  config {
    name: "linux.ftrace"
    target_buffer: 0
    ftrace_config {
      ftrace_events: "ticker/ticker_tick"
    }
  }
}

# 10s trace, but can be stopped prematurely.
duration_ms: 10000
```

See the [system tracing page](/docs/getting-started/system-tracing.md) in order
to get set up with tracebox. For this example we are going to record a trace
from the command line using the config file we just created:
```bash
./tracebox -c ticker.cfg --txt -o ticker.pftrace
```

Note: tracebox will take care of enabling tracing and our ticker events (as we
did manually in the preceding step).

This will write a perfetto protobuf trace to `ticker.pftrace`.

### View the perfetto trace in the UI

We can now explore the recorded trace in the perfetto UI. Navigate to
https://ui.perfetto.dev and drag-n-drop your file into the window (or press
`Ctrl+O` to bring up the open file dialog).

Expand the "Ftrace Events" track group for a per-cpu view of events, which can
be selected to show their fields. Additionally, `Ctrl+shift+P -> "Show Ftrace
Tab"` opens up a tab with an approximation of the textual output. However note
that because perfetto records the binary representation of events, it does not
textualise the events according to the `TP_printk(..)` specifier.

![Raw ticker events](https://storage.googleapis.com/perfetto-misc/ticker-raw.gif)

The events can also be queried with a query like:
```sql
SELECT * FROM ftrace_event JOIN args USING (arg_set_id)
```

## Part B: Integrating new tracepoints with perfetto

To add dedicated parsing for this new tracepoint in Perfetto, we need to:
- generate a protobuf description of the event, so that the serialising code (in
  traced\_probes or tracebox) can write the events as that protobuf type,
  instead of a generic fallback encoding that was implicitly used above.
- add a decoder to trace\_processor (the query engine) that creates the desired
  tracks out of the new events when parsing the protobuf trace.

As an example, we'll parse the ticker event into a global counter track.

(We'll be modifying perfetto sources so clone the repository if you have not
already done so. The rest of the instructions assume that your current directory
is the repository's root.)

### Generate the protobuf event description in perfetto

First, copy the "format" file that describes the event in the tracefs filesystem
to perfetto:
```sh
DEST=src/traced/probes/ftrace/test/data/synthetic/events/ticker/ticker_tick; \
mkdir -p $DEST && \
cp /sys/kernel/tracing/events/ticker/ticker_tick/format $DEST/format
```

Then add the event to the following list:
```sh
echo "ticker/ticker_tick" >> src/tools/ftrace_proto_gen/event_list
```

Then run the generator scripts to create the protobuf description and
other compile-time files for both the serialising and decoding code:
```sh
tools/run_ftrace_proto_gen
tools/gen_all out/YOUR_BUILD_DIRECTORY
```

This should create/modify at least the following files:
`protos/perfetto/trace/ftrace/ftrace_event.proto`,
`protos/perfetto/trace/ftrace/ticker.proto`,
`src/traced/probes/ftrace/event_info.cc`,
`protos/perfetto/trace/perfetto_trace.proto`.

This is sufficient for the serialising logic to start using the dedicated
protobuf type for your events. Note: when recording, perfetto reads the event's
format file in tracefs at runtime, and serialises only the fields that were
known at perfetto's compile time.

Rebuild `tracebox` locally with your changes and re-record the trace.

### Parse the event in trace\_processor

Now we can add the decoding and parsing logic for the protobufs to the
[ftrace\_parser.cc][ftrace-parser-link] in the trace\_processor.

As an example, to create a single global counter track for all events:
- add a case to the large `ParseFtraceEvent` switch-case.
- add a function that interns a track and attaches all of the timestamped values
  as counts.

Example additions (omitting the header change):

```c++
// ftrace_parser.cc

static constexpr auto kTickerCountBlueprint = tracks::CounterBlueprint(
      "ticker",
      tracks::UnknownUnitBlueprint(),
      tracks::DimensionBlueprints(),
      tracks::StaticNameBlueprint("Ticker"));

// ~~ snip ~~

      case FtraceEvent::kTickerEventFieldNumber: {
        ParseTickerEvent(cpu, ts, fld_bytes);
        break;
      }

// ~~ snip ~~

void FtraceParser::ParseTickerEvent(uint32_t cpu,
                                    int64_t timestamp,
                                    protozero::ConstBytes data) {
  protos::pbzero::TickerEventFtraceEvent::Decoder ticker_event(data);

  PERFETTO_LOG("Parsing ticker event: %" PRId64 ", %" PRIu32 ", %d",
               timestamp,
               cpu,
               static_cast<int>(ticker_event.count()));

  // Push the global counter.
  TrackId track = context_->track_tracker->InternTrack(kTickerCountBlueprint);
  context_->event_tracker->PushCounter(
      timestamp, static_cast<double>(ticker_event.count()), track);
}
```

After rebuilding the `trace_processor` (or the whole UI), the data can be
queried from the counter table:
```
SELECT *
FROM counter
JOIN counter_track ct ON ct.id = counter.track_id
WHERE ct.type = 'ticker'
```

### Visualise the track in the UI

In order to actually see this track in the UI it needs to be added by some UI
code (organised in perfetto as plugins). We'll use the simplest option,
`dev.perfetto.TraceProcessorTrack`. Make the following edit to add all counter
tracks of type "ticker" to the `SYSTEM` top level group:

```ts
// ui/src/plugins/dev.perfetto.TraceProcessorTrack/counter_tracks.ts
~~ snip ~~
  {
    type: 'ticker',
    topLevelGroup: 'SYSTEM',
    group: undefined,
  },
~~ snip ~~
```

Rebuild a local UI (`ui/run-dev-server`). Open the re-recorded trace (with the
tracebox that had compile-time knowledge of the event). You should now see a
dedicated UI track with your event's data.

![Ticker counter track](https://storage.googleapis.com/perfetto-misc/ticker-counter-track.gif)

This is the most complete way of adding ftrace events to the perfetto stack.
There are quite a few steps and a need for upstreaming your changes, but this
gives you full power to do arbitrary parsing in the trace\_processor code, and
makes the results available to all users of perfetto.

## Part C: Simple slice/counter visualisations without modifying perfetto code (kernel track events)

There is a simpler way for perfetto to automatically create basic slice &
counter tracks from events, that is more suitable for people tinkering with a
local kernel or writing a module that won't be upstreamed to the mainline
kernel. This lets you focus on instrumenting your code instead of changing
perfetto itself.

Consider the case of slices, usually derived from a pair of events - one
signifying the start of the slice, and the other ending it. There needs to be a
convention for perfetto to know that a given tracepoint is to be interpreted
this way.

What perfetto does is look for specifically-named tracepoint fields
(`TP_STRUCT__entry(..)` part of the definition). If your tracepoint matches this
convention, trace\_processor and the UI will automatically try to group the
events on tracks. With grouping (scoping) controlled by further conventions.

The following sections give an example tracepoint template for a few common
cases, and their expected visualisation:
* slice tracks for synchronous code, where the operations are ended on the same
  thread that they're started, for example before and after a loop in a single
  function.
* process-scoped slice tracks for events that are best visualised when grouped
  at the process level.
* cpu-scoped counter tracks for events that represent per-cpu counters.

NOTE: The full reference with details on scoping and track naming options is at
["Kernel track events: format and conventions"][trackevent-reference-link].

[trackevent-reference-link]: /docs/reference/kernel-track-event

### Thread-scoped slice tracks

The simplest case if you want to visualise the duration of (potentially nested)
regions of code where the beginning and the end happen on the same thread.

Perfetto can be hinted that your tracepoint should be parsed into thread-scoped
slice tracks simply by having two fields with "well known" names and types in
the layout of the tracepoint (`TP_STRUCT__entry(...`):
* `char track_event_type`
* `__string slice_name`

Perfetto will interpret the events as slices or instants based on the value of
`track_event_type` in the actual timestamped event:
* `'B'` opens a named slice (from `slice_name`) on the active thread.
* `'E'` ends the last opened slice on the thread (`slice_name` is ignored).
* `'I'` sets an instant (zero duration) event with the name taken from
  `slice_name`.

The thread id and timestamp are implicitly part of every ftrace event already,
and do not need to be specified.

Tracepoint declaration example, named `trk_example/tid_track_example`:

```h
// trace/events/trk_example.h
#undef TRACE_SYSTEM
#define TRACE_SYSTEM trk_example

#if !defined(_TRACE_TRK_EXAMPLE_H_) || defined(TRACE_HEADER_MULTI_READ)
#define _TRACE_TRK_EXAMPLE_H_

#include <linux/tracepoint.h>

TRACE_EVENT(tid_track_example,
    TP_PROTO(
        char track_event_type,
        const char *slice_name
    ),
    TP_ARGS(track_event_type, slice_name),
    TP_STRUCT__entry(
        __field(char, track_event_type)
        __string(slice_name, slice_name)
    ),
    TP_fast_assign(
        __entry->track_event_type = track_event_type;
        __assign_str(slice_name);
    ),
    TP_printk(
        "type=%c slice_name=%s",
        __entry->track_event_type,
        __get_str(slice_name)
    )
);

#endif

/* This part must be outside protection */
#include <trace/define_trace.h>
```

Note that only the types and names of `TP_STRUCT__entry` matter, there are no
constraints on extra fields, the printk specifier, or even field order.

For convenience, the tracepoint invocations can be wrapped with macros:
```h
// Convenience macros
#define TRACE_EX_BEGIN(name)   trace_tid_track_example('B', name)
#define TRACE_EX_END()         trace_tid_track_example('E', "")
#define TRACE_EX_INSTANT(name) trace_tid_track_example('I', name)
```

Example of instrumented code, demonstrating nested slices and instants:
```c
TRACE_EX_BEGIN("outer");
udelay(500);
for (int i=0; i < 3; i++) {
    TRACE_EX_BEGIN("nested");
    udelay(1000);
    TRACE_EX_INSTANT("instant");
    TRACE_EX_END();
}
TRACE_EX_END();
```

We can record a trace with the following config (at the time of writing, the
`denser_generic_event_encoding` is necessary, but is likely to become the
default):

```
// trace.txtpb
duration_ms: 10000

buffers: {
  size_kb: 40960
  fill_policy: DISCARD
}

data_sources: {
  config: {
    name: "linux.ftrace"
    ftrace_config: {
      denser_generic_event_encoding: true
      ftrace_events: "trk_example/*"
    }
  }
}
```

Resulting tracks automatically derived by perfetto trace\_processor and UI. Note
that each thread gets its own separate track, and the tracks are automatically
nested under the process track group:

![thread scoped slice UI](/docs/images/kernel-trackevent-tid-slice.png)

### Process-scoped slice tracks

Similar to the preceding example, but with slice events grouped at the process
level. Note: this allows terminating slices from a different thread than which
started the operation, but the grouped slices *must* have strict nesting - all
slices must terminate before their parents (see the concept of [async
slices][async-slice-link] for more details).

[async-slice-link]: /docs/getting-started/converting#asynchronous-slices-and-overlapping-events

The expected fields in `TP_STRUCT__entry` for this type of parsing:
* `char track_event_type`
* `__string slice_name`
* `int scope_tgid`

The first two fields are interpreted as in the preceding example, while the
`scope_tgid` has to be populated with the process id (aka TGID) under which that
particular event should be grouped. The process id should be real (don't
hardcode arbitrary constants), but the emitting thread does not have to be in
that process.

Tracepoint declaration example, named `trk_example/tgid_track_example`:

```h
// trace/events/trk_example.h
#undef TRACE_SYSTEM
#define TRACE_SYSTEM trk_example

#if !defined(_TRACE_TRK_EXAMPLE_H_) || defined(TRACE_HEADER_MULTI_READ)
#define _TRACE_TRK_EXAMPLE_H_

#include <linux/tracepoint.h>

TRACE_EVENT(tgid_counter_example,
    TP_PROTO(
        u64 counter_value,
        int scope_tgid
    ),
    TP_ARGS(counter_value, scope_tgid),
    TP_STRUCT__entry(
        __field(u64, counter_value)
        __field(int, scope_tgid)
    ),
    TP_fast_assign(
        __entry->counter_value = counter_value;
        __entry->scope_tgid = scope_tgid;
    ),
    TP_printk(
        "counter_value=%llu tgid=%d",
        (unsigned long long)__entry->counter_value,
        __entry->scope_tgid
    )
);

#endif

/* This part must be outside protection */
#include <trace/define_trace.h>
```

Example convenience macros, using the current process context (`current->tgid`)
for grouping events:

```h
// Convenience macros
#define TRACE_EX_BEGIN(name)   trace_tgid_track_example('B', name, current->tgid)
#define TRACE_EX_END()         trace_tgid_track_example('E', "", current->tgid)
#define TRACE_EX_INSTANT(name) trace_tgid_track_example('I', name, current->tgid)
```

Example of instrumented code, as before:
```c
TRACE_EX_BEGIN("outer");
udelay(500);
for (int i=0; i < 3; i++) {
    TRACE_EX_BEGIN("nested");
    udelay(1000);
    TRACE_EX_INSTANT("instant");
    TRACE_EX_END();
}
TRACE_EX_END();
```

Resulting visualisation, when recorded using the config from the preceding
example. All slice stacks are aggregated at the process level:

![process scoped slice UI](/docs/images/kernel-trackevent-tgid-slice.png)

### CPU-scoped counter tracks

Similarly to slices and instants, there is a convention for tracepoints to be
automatically presented as tracks in perfetto. The counters can also be grouped
by thread/process, but this example demonstrates per-cpu grouping.

The expected fields in `TP_STRUCT__entry` for this type of parsing:
* `u64 counter_value` (any intergral type is accepted)
* `int scope_cpu`

Tracepoint declaration example, named `trk_example/cpu_counter_example`:

```h
// trace/events/trk_example.h
#undef TRACE_SYSTEM
#define TRACE_SYSTEM trk_example

#if !defined(_TRACE_TRK_EXAMPLE_H_) || defined(TRACE_HEADER_MULTI_READ)
#define _TRACE_TRK_EXAMPLE_H_

#include <linux/tracepoint.h>

TRACE_EVENT(cpu_counter_example,

    TP_PROTO(
        u64 counter_value,
        int scope_cpu
    ),

    TP_ARGS(counter_value, scope_cpu),
    TP_STRUCT__entry(
        __field(u64, counter_value)
        __field(int, scope_cpu)
    ),
    TP_fast_assign(
        __entry->counter_value = counter_value;
        __entry->scope_cpu = scope_cpu;
    ),
    TP_printk(
        "counter_value=%llu cpu=%d",
        (unsigned long long)__entry->counter_value,
        __entry->scope_cpu
    )
);

#endif

/* This part must be outside protection */
#include <trace/define_trace.h>
```

Example of instrumented code:
```c
static unsigned int n = 0

trace_cpu_counter_example(n++, smp_processor_id());
```

Resulting visualisation, when recorded using the config from the preceding
examples. With counter increments being attributed to the cpu that executed the
tracepoint (due to the use of `smp_processor_id()` as the cpu index, but we
