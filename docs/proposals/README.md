# Proposals

This directory contains lightweight proposals for changes and enhancements to
Perfetto. Unlike design docs which document the state as implemented, proposals
represent ideas that are either work-in-progress or aspirational for future
development.

## Purpose

This is a low-overhead space for:

- Ideas from team discussions
- Feature proposals and enhancement suggestions
- Work-in-progress thoughts before they become formal design docs

## Guidelines

Create a `.md` file with a descriptive name. Keep it simple - focus on the core
idea rather than detailed implementation.

Minimal structure:

```markdown
# Brief Title

- **Status**: draft
- **Author**: your-name

Summary of the idea and motivation.
```

No templates or mandatory sections required.

## Organization

- **STATUS.md**: Quick overview of all proposals. Note this can get out of date
  if not maintained.
- **archive/**: Move implemented or rejected proposals here to keep the main
  directory clean.
