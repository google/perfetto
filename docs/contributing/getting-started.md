### Contributing

NOTE: In March 2025 our team has moved the primary development of Perfetto
to GitHub (previously on Android Gerrit).

#### Googlers

NOTE: Follow the instructions at [go/perfetto-github-instructions](http://go/perfetto-github-instructions).

1. Make sure you/your organization has signed the Google CLA at [cla.developers.google.com](https://cla.developers.google.com/)
2. Create a branch with the change:

```sh
git checkout -b first-contribution
```

3. Make change in the repo.
4. Add, commit and upload the change:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "My first contribution"
gh pr create  # Requires cli.github.com
```

Please note our project follows the [Google C++ style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), and targets `-std=c++17`.

#### External contributors

Please contribute the same way as you would to any other Github repository.
A good explanation of how to do it can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project).

### Testing

As Perfetto has a rather complicated testing strategy, we will automatically run our presubmit on each push into the repo.
For manual run: `tools/run_presubmit`.

For more information on testing Perfetto go to [testing page](testing).

## What's next?

You might want to contribute to the UI, Trace Processor, SDK or various data importers.

- If you want to add a new functionality to the UI, most likely the next step is the [UI getting started](ui-getting-started).
- If you want to edit the core functionality of the UI: it's a much bigger change which would require in depth understanding of Perfetto UI. Most requests/bugs now are related to various plugins, not the core.
- If you want to add a new ftrace event take a look at [common tasks page](common-tasks).
- If you want to add a new table/view/function to Perfetto SQL standard library you need to first undestand [the Perfetto SQL syntax](/docs/analysis/perfetto-sql-syntax.md), and then read the details of updating the standard library at [common tasks page](common-tasks).
- If you want to add a support of a new file type into Perfetto, you need to add a new `importer` to Trace Processor C++ code.
