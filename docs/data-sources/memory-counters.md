# Memory counters and events

Perfetto allows to gather a number of memory events and counters on
Android and Linux. These events come from kernel interfaces, both ftrace and
/proc interfaces, and are of two types: polled counters and events pushed by
the kernel in the ftrace buffer.

## Per-process polled counters

The process stats data source allows to poll `/proc/<pid>/status` and
`/proc/<pid>/oom_score_adj` at user-defined intervals.

See [`man 5 proc`][man-proc] for their semantic.

### UI

![](/docs/images/proc_stat.png "UI showing trace data collected by process stats pollers")

### SQL

```sql
select c.ts, c.value, t.name as counter_name, p.name as proc_name, p.pid
from counter as c left join process_counter_track as t on c.track_id = t.id
left join process as p using (upid)
where t.name like 'mem.%'
```
ts | counter_name | value_kb | proc_name | pid
---|--------------|----------|-----------|----
261187015027350 | mem.virt | 1326464 | com.android.vending | 28815

261187090251420 | mem.virt | 1326464 | com.android.vending | 28815

### TraceConfig

To collect process stat counters every X ms set `proc_stats_poll_ms = X` in
your process stats config. X must be greater than 100ms to avoid excessive CPU
usage. Details about the specific counters being collected can be found in the
[ProcessStats reference](/docs/reference/trace-packet-proto.autogen#ProcessStats).

```protobuf
data_sources: {
    config {
        name: "linux.process_stats"
        process_stats_config {
            scan_all_processes_on_start: true
            proc_stats_poll_ms: 1000
        }
    }
}
```

## Per-process memory events (ftrace)

### rss_stat

Recent versions of the Linux kernel allow to report ftrace events when the
Resident Set Size (RSS) mm counters change. This is the same counter available
in `/proc/pid/status` as `VmRSS`. The main advantage of this event is that by
being an event-driven push event it allows to detect very short memory usage
bursts that would be otherwise undetectable by using /proc counters.

Memory usage peaks of hundreds of MB can have dramatically negative impact on
Android, even if they last only few ms, as they can cause mass low memory kills
to reclaim memory.

The kernel feature that supports this has been introduced in the Linux Kernel
in [b3d1411b6] and later improved by [e4dcad20]. They are available in upstream
since Linux v5.5-rc1. This patch has been backported in several Google Pixel
kernels running Android 10 (Q).

[b3d1411b6]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/b3d1411b6726ea6930222f8f12587d89762477c6
[e4dcad20]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/e4dcad204d3a281be6f8573e0a82648a4ad84e69

### mm_event

`mm_event` is an ftrace event that captures statistics about key memory events
(a subset of the ones exposed by `/proc/vmstat`). Unlike RSS-stat counter
updates, mm events are extremely high volume and tracing them individually would
be unfeasible. `mm_event` instead reports only periodic histograms in the trace,
reducing sensibly the overhead.

`mm_event` is available only on some Google Pixel kernels running Android 10 (Q)
and beyond.

When `mm_event` is enabled, the following mm event types are recorded:

* mem.mm.min_flt: Minor page faults
* mem.mm.maj_flt: Major page faults
* mem.mm.swp_flt: Page faults served by swapcache
* mem.mm.read_io: Read page faults backed by I/O
* mem.mm..compaction: Memory compaction events
* mem.mm.reclaim: Memory reclaim events

For each event type, the event records:

* count: how many times the event happened since the previous event.
* min_lat: the smallest latency (the duration of the mm event) recorded since
  the previous event.
* max_lat: the highest latency recorded since the previous event.

### UI

![rss_stat and mm_event](/docs/images/rss_stat_and_mm_event.png)

### SQL

At the SQL level, these events are imported and exposed in the same way as
the corresponding polled events. This allows to collect both types of events
(pushed and polled) and treat them uniformly in queries and scripts.

```sql
select c.ts, c.value, t.name as counter_name, p.name as proc_name, p.pid
from counter as c left join process_counter_track as t on c.track_id = t.id
left join process as p using (upid)
where t.name like 'mem.%'
```

ts | value | counter_name | proc_name | pid
---|-------|--------------|-----------|----
777227867975055 | 18358272 | mem.rss.anon | com.google.android.apps.safetyhub | 31386
777227865995315 | 5 | mem.mm.min_flt.count | com.google.android.apps.safetyhub | 31386
777227865995315 | 8 | mem.mm.min_flt.max_lat | com.google.android.apps.safetyhub | 31386

777227865998023 | 3 | mem.mm.swp_flt.count | com.google.android.apps.safetyhub | 31386

### TraceConfig

```protobuf
data_sources: {
    config {
        name: "linux.ftrace"
        ftrace_config {
            ftrace_events: "kmem/rss_stat"
            ftrace_events: "mm_event/mm_event_record"
        }
    }
}

# This is for getting Thread<>Process associations and full process names.
data_sources: {
    config {
        name: "linux.process_stats"
    }
}
```

## System-wide polled counters

This data source allows periodic polling of system data from:

- `/proc/stat`
- `/proc/vmstat`
- `/proc/meminfo`

See [`man 5 proc`][man-proc] for their semantic.

### UI

![System Memory Counters](/docs/images/sys_stat_counters.png
"Example of system memory counters in the UI")

The polling period and specific counters to include in the trace can be set in the trace config.

### SQL

```sql
select c.ts, t.name, c.value / 1024 as value_kb from counters as c left join counter_track as t on c.track_id = t.id
```

ts | name | value_kb
---|------|---------
775177736769834 | MemAvailable | 1708956

## Low-memory Kills (LMK)

#### Background

The Android framework kills apps and services, especially background ones, to
make room for newly opened apps when memory is needed. These are known as low
memory kills (LMK).

Note LMKs are not always the symptom of a performance problem. The rule of thumb
is that the severity (as in: user perceived impact) is proportional to the state
of the app being killed. The app state can be derived in a trace from the OOM
adjustment score.

A LMK of a foreground app or service is typically a big concern. This happens
when the app that the user was using disappeared under their fingers, or their
favorite music player service suddenly stopped playing music.

A LMK of a cached app or service, instead, is frequently business-as-usual and
in most cases won't be noticed by the end user until they try to go back to
the app, which will then cold-start.

The situation in between these extremes is more nuanced. LMKs of cached
apps/service can be still problematic if it happens in storms (i.e. observing
that most processes get LMK-ed in a short time frame) and are often the symptom
of some component of the system causing memory spikes.

### lowmemorykiller vs lmkd

#### In-kernel lowmemorykiller driver
In Android, LMK used to be handled by an ad-hoc kernel-driver,
Linux's [drivers/staging/android/lowmemorykiller.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.8/drivers/staging/android/lowmemorykiller.c).
This driver uses to emit the ftrace event `lowmemorykiller/lowmemory_kill`
in the trace.

#### Userspace lmkd

Android 9 introduced a userspace native daemon that took over the LMK
responsibility: `lmkd`. Not all devices running Android 9 will
necessarily use `lmkd` as the ultimate choice of in-kernel vs userspace is
up to the phone manufacturer, their kernel version and kernel config.

On Google Pixel phones, `lmkd`-side killing is used since Pixel 2 running
Android 9.

See https://source.android.com/devices/tech/perf/lmkd for details.

`lmkd` emits a userspace atrace counter event called `kill_one_process`.

#### Android LMK vs Linux oomkiller

LMKs on Android, whether the old in-kernel `lowmemkiller` or the newer `lmkd`,
use a completely different mechanism than the standard
[Linux kernel's OOM Killer](https://linux-mm.org/OOM_Killer).
Perfetto at the moment supports only Android LMK events (Both in-kernel and
user-space) and does not support tracing of Linux kernel OOM Killer events.
Linux OOMKiller events are still theoretically possible on Android but extremely
unlikely to happen. If they happen, they are more likely the symptom of a
mis-configured BSP.

### UI

Newer userspace LMKs are available in the UI under the `lmkd` track
in the form of a counter. The counter value is the PID of the killed process
(in the example below, PID=27985).

![Userspace lmkd](/docs/images/lmk_lmkd.png "Example of a LMK caused by lmkd")

### SQL

Both newer lmkd and legacy kernel-driven lowmemorykiller events are normalized
at import time and available under the `mem.lmk` key in the `instants` table.

```sql
SELECT ts, process.name, process.pid
FROM instant
JOIN process_track ON instant.track_id = process_track.id
JOIN process USING (upid)
WHERE instant.name = 'mem.lmk'
```

| ts | name | pid |
|----|------|-----|
| 442206415875043 | roid.apps.turbo | 27324 |
| 442206446142234 | android.process.acore | 27683 |
| 442206462090204 | com.google.process.gapps | 28198 |

### TraceConfig

To enable tracing of low memory kills add the following options to trace config:

```protobuf
data_sources: {
    config {
        name: "linux.ftrace"
        ftrace_config {
            # For old in-kernel events.
            ftrace_events: "lowmemorykiller/lowmemory_kill"

            # For new userspace lmkds.
            atrace_apps: "lmkd"

            # This is not strictly required but is useful to know the state
            # of the process (FG, cached, ...) before it got killed.
            ftrace_events: "oom/oom_score_adj_update"
        }
    }
}
```

## {#oom-adj} App states and OOM adjustment score

The Android app state can be inferred in a trace from the process
`oom_score_adj`. The mapping is not 1:1, there are more states than
oom_score_adj value groups and the `oom_score_adj` range for cached processes
spans from 900 to 1000.

The mapping can be inferred from the
[ActivityManager's ProcessList sources](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/android10-release:frameworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/am/ProcessList.java;l=126)
