# Querying Perfetto traces

This reference explains how to extract data from a Perfetto trace file
(`.pftrace`, `.perfetto-trace`, `.pb`) using `trace_processor` and
PerfettoSQL. Read it for ad-hoc querying outside a guided workflow; the
workflows under `../workflows/` carry their own queries.

The `trace_processor` binary is what every other Perfetto analysis tool
runs on top of, including the Perfetto UI. Reference docs:
<https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/trace-processor>.

> **Prerequisite — `trace_processor` must be invokable.** Before
> running any of the shell commands below, read
> `../environment-references/setup.md`. It defines the exact invocation
> form for `trace_processor` in this environment — substitute it for
> every bare `trace_processor` reference below. It also covers
> installing the `perfetto` Python client, which the long-running RPC
> mode needs.

## Quickstart

To run a single query and exit:

```sh
trace_processor query TRACE_FILE "SELECT ts, dur FROM slice LIMIT 10"
```

Multiple statements separated by `;` are supported in one invocation.

`TRACE_FILE` can be a local path, an `http(s)://` URL, or a Perfetto UI
share link (`https://ui.perfetto.dev/#!/?s=<hash>`) — in the last two
cases trace_processor downloads the trace for you, resolving the share
link to its underlying trace first:

```sh
trace_processor query "https://ui.perfetto.dev/#!/?s=<hash>" \
  "SELECT name, dur FROM slice ORDER BY dur DESC LIMIT 10"
```

Downloaded traces are cached locally (under `~/.cache/perfetto/`, or the
platform equivalent), so re-running on the same URL doesn't re-download.
The same `URL`/share-link form works anywhere a trace path is accepted
(`query`, `server`, the interactive shell, etc.).

## Long-running mode (preferred for iteration)

Reparsing a trace on every query is slow — for a multi-GB trace it's tens
of seconds, every time. When you expect to run more than a couple of
queries, start the shell once as an HTTP RPC server and drive it from
the Python client. (If the Python client is not installed yet,
`../environment-references/setup.md` covers it.)

```sh
# Terminal A: pick a random high port and start the server on it.
# Always pass --port explicitly: the default (9001) is also used by
# the Perfetto UI, and a fixed port collides with any other agent
# already running a trace_processor server.
PORT=$((9100 + RANDOM % 900))
trace_processor server http --port $PORT TRACE_FILE
```

```python
# Terminal B (or any Python process): connect to the running server.
# PORT is the value chosen in Terminal A.
from perfetto.trace_processor import TraceProcessor

tp = TraceProcessor(addr='127.0.0.1:PORT')
for row in tp.query('SELECT ts, dur, name FROM slice WHERE dur > 5e8 LIMIT 5'):
    print(row.dur, row.name)

# Pandas is also supported if the dependency is installed:
df = tp.query('SELECT ts, dur, name FROM slice LIMIT 100').as_pandas_dataframe()

tp.close()
```

> **Tip for Multi-statement SQL:** When writing SQL queries to a
> separate `.sql` file, you can read and execute the file directly:
> ```python
> with open(QUERY_FILE_PATH, 'r') as f:
>   tp.query(f.read())
> ```
> For shorter or simpler queries, passing a string directly to
> `tp.query("SELECT...")` within your script works perfectly fine.

The server keeps the trace parsed in memory; each `tp.query()` call is
just a query against the existing session. This is the same RPC channel
`ui.perfetto.dev` uses when you load a trace there.

Notes:

- Use `'127.0.0.1:PORT'`, not `'localhost:PORT'`. The server binds on
  IPv4/IPv6 explicitly and `localhost` resolution can pick an interface
  that isn't bound on macOS.
- A quick liveness check from the shell:
  `curl -sIf -m 1 http://127.0.0.1:PORT/status` is the fastest way
  to confirm the server is up.
- The on-the-wire `/query`, `/parse`, `/rpc` endpoints take protobuf-
  encoded `QueryArgs`/`TraceProcessorRpc` payloads. **Do not hand-craft
  HTTP calls with `curl`** — use the Python client (or the WASM
  client embedded in the UI). Hand-crafted calls work for `/status` only.
- If you want to stay in the C++ shell instead of Python, a one-shot
  `trace_processor query TRACE_FILE "..."` is fine for a handful of
  queries; the server is the right answer the moment iteration starts.

## Discovering what's in the trace

PerfettoSQL ships with **intrinsic table-functions** for browsing the
loaded standard library — modules, tables/views, functions, macros. Use
these to find what's available and to verify if a Standard Library module
already provides the needed abstraction before drafting custom logic.

**Mandatory Schema Check:** Do not guess column names or join keys. Always
use a plain `LIMIT 0` query to read the exact column schema of any specific
table, view, or query result before drafting your query.

> **Intrinsic surface — not stable API.** The `__intrinsic_*` names below
> are an implementation detail of trace processor. They're fair game for
> an agent to use during a session because this reference is loaded, but
> **don't bake `__intrinsic_*` names into committed scripts, dashboards,
> or stdlib modules** — they can change without notice.

```sql
-- 1. List every stdlib module currently available.
SELECT package, module FROM __intrinsic_stdlib_modules ORDER BY 1, 2;

-- 2. List the tables/views a specific module exposes
--    (after INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE).
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE slices.with_context;
SELECT name, type, exposed, description
FROM __intrinsic_stdlib_tables('slices.with_context');

-- 3. List functions / macros a module exposes.
SELECT name, return_type, args
FROM __intrinsic_stdlib_functions('slices.with_context');
SELECT name, return_type, args
FROM __intrinsic_stdlib_macros('android.memory.heap_graph.helpers');

-- 4. Read the column schema of any table, view, or query.
--    LIMIT 0 returns the result header with no row scan; trace_processor
--    prints "column N = <name>" lines for each column.
SELECT * FROM slice LIMIT 0;
SELECT * FROM thread_or_process_slice LIMIT 0;
SELECT * FROM (SELECT ts, dur, name FROM slice WHERE dur > 0) LIMIT 0;
```

Useful starting points for any trace:

| View           | What's in it                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `slice`        | Atrace slices, async slices, anything with a duration on a track |
| `thread`       | One row per thread                                              |
| `process`      | One row per process                                             |
| `thread_state` | Scheduling state transitions (Running, Runnable, Sleeping, …)   |
| `sched_slice`  | When threads were on-CPU                                        |
| `counter`      | Time-series counter samples                                     |
| `track`        | Every track in the trace; join on `track_id` to most other tables |

trace_processor): <https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/sql-tables>.


## Using the standard library

Most useful queries are *much* shorter when you build on stdlib modules
instead of joining raw tables yourself. Generated stdlib reference:
<https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/stdlib-docs>.

Include a module before referencing the views, tables or macros it
defines:

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE slices.with_context;

SELECT name, dur, thread_name, process_name
FROM thread_or_process_slice
WHERE dur > 1e9                     -- slices longer than 1s
ORDER BY dur DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

A few commonly used modules to know:

- `slices.with_context` — slice rows joined with their thread / process.
- `sched.with_context` — `sched_slice` joined with thread / process.
- `android.startup.startups` — one row per app startup.
- `stacks.cpu_profiling` — flat samples and call-graph helpers.
- `android.memory.heap_graph.dominator_tree` — retained-size analysis for
  Java heap dumps (see `../workflows/android_memory/heap_dump.md` for usage).

The module name maps directly to the file path under the stdlib root:
`foo.bar` lives at `foo/bar.sql`. Browse the full list at the stdlib
reference linked above.


## Tips for writing good PerfettoSQL

- **Reach for stdlib first.** If you find yourself joining `slice` to
  `thread_track` to `thread` to `process`, there is almost certainly a
  stdlib module that already does it. Check the stdlib reference before
  writing the join.
- **Filter on `dur > 0` and Trace Boundaries carefully.** Some slices have
  `dur = -1` (still open at trace end) and some have `dur = 0` (instant
  events). Be explicit about which you mean. When calculating a bounding box
  (for example, `ts + dur`) or summing durations (`SUM(dur)`), handle
  incomplete durations using: `IIF(dur = -1, trace_end() - ts, dur)`.
- **Robust State Transitions.** Avoid manual timestamp arithmetic (for
  example, `ts + dur = next.ts`) to join adjacent events. Rely on standard
  library modules (for example, `sched.runnable`, `linux.perf.counters`,
  `intervals.overlap`) which safely handle trace gaps and preemptions.
- **Working with Identifiers:**
  - **Use Unique Identifiers for Joins:** When writing SQL queries in
    Perfetto, you must join tables using `utid` (unique thread ID) or `upid`
    (unique process ID) instead of the regular `tid` or `pid`. **Why it's
    useful**: The operating system recycles `TIDs` and `PIDs`, while `UTIDs`
    and `UPIDs` remain unique for the lifetime of the trace, which prevents
    incorrect joins.
  - Columns like `id`, `utid`, `upid`, `track_id` are not stable across traces
    or even runs of trace_processor on the same trace. You can use them
    **inside** a query as join keys, but alongside the IDS, always join out to
    a stable name (`thread.name`, `process.name`, `slice.name`) when reporting
    results to the user.
  - **Materialise expensive intermediate results.** `CREATE PERFETTO TABLE foo
    AS SELECT ...` caches the result so subsequent queries don't redo the work.
    - *Note for `SPAN_JOIN`:* Intermediate tables fed into a `SPAN_JOIN` must
      be materialized using `CREATE PERFETTO TABLE`, not `CREATE VIEW`.
- **Idempotency.** Ensure queries are idempotent to prevent "already exists"
  errors during multiple executions.
  - For Perfetto objects, always use `CREATE OR REPLACE`: `CREATE OR REPLACE
    PERFETTO {TABLE|VIEW|MACRO|FUNCTION}`.
  - For SQLite Virtual Tables (such as `SPAN_JOIN`), `CREATE OR REPLACE` is
    not supported. Explicitly drop them first: `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS
    my_table; CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE my_table USING SPAN_JOIN(...);`
  - For standard SQLite indexes, prepend `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS index_name;`.
- **`SPAN_JOIN` safety.** `SPAN_JOIN` will crash if intervals **within the
  same input table** overlap. Always use the `PARTITIONED {column}` (for
  example, `PARTITIONED track_id`) clause to isolate intervals.
- **Avoid `SELECT *` in saved queries.** Trace processor table schemas can
  gain columns; pin the columns you actually use.
- **Use `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` if a query is slow.** It shows whether SQLite is
  using indexes. Counter and slice tables have built-in indexes on `ts` and
  `track_id`; queries that don't filter on either will scan the whole table.
- **Argument Extraction:** Use `EXTRACT_ARG(arg_set_id, 'key')` to fetch event
  properties instead of manually joining the `args` table.
- **JSON Parsing:** When dealing with JSON text, use standard SQLite JSON
  functions (for example, `json_extract()`) to extract values.
- **String Matching (Always use GLOB).** Use `GLOB` instead of `LIKE`. `LIKE`
  causes performance bottlenecks and treats underscores (`_`) as wildcards,
  leading to bugs.
  - **Exact matches:** Use `=`.
  - **Substring matches:** Use `GLOB` with `*` (for example, `name GLOB
    '*RenderThread*'`).
  - **Case-insensitive matches:** Use `LOWER(name) GLOB` and make sure the
    search string is fully lowercase (for example, `LOWER(name) GLOB
    '*renderthread*'`). Use this when dealing with inconsistent trace
    capitalization (for example, `WakeLock` versus `wakelock`).
- **Alias Precision.** Always prefix column names with table or view alias,
  that is: `{alias}.{column_name}`.

## Common Analysis Patterns

- **Calculating Time Overlaps & CPU Time:**
  1.  **Primary Method (MANDATORY):** Always search the standard library first
    before writing custom interval logic. For example, to find the exact CPU
    execution time of a slice, do not calculate it manually; instead, search
    the docs and use the `slices.cpu_time` module.
  2.  **Fallback Method (Use ONLY if you have verified no stdlib module or
    `SPAN_JOIN` applies):** If you must calculate custom overlap durations
    between two different sets of time intervals `[start1, end1]` and
    `[start2, end2]`:
  - **Condition:** The intervals overlap if `start1 < end2` and `start2
      < end1`.
  - **Duration:** The overlap duration is calculated as `MIN(end1, end2)
    - MAX(start1, start2)`.
  - **Important:** Incomplete Perfetto slices have a duration of -1
    (`dur = -1`). Always calculate the effective end time using `ts +
      IIF(dur = -1, trace_end() - ts, dur)` before applying this logic.
- **Window Size:** When looking for events around a specific timestamp, start
  with 100ms as the window size.
- **Total Duration:** To calculate the total time spent in slices matching a
  specific name pattern (for example, `*{name_pattern}*`), you must sum their
  durations. **Why it's useful**: This helps quantify the total impact of a
  specific function or feature on performance across multiple calls. Here is
  an example query (note the safe handling of incomplete slices):
  ```sql
  SELECT
  count(*) as total_count,
  sum(IIF(slice.dur = -1, trace_end() - slice.ts, slice.dur)) / 1000000.0 as total_dur_ms
  FROM slice
  WHERE slice.name GLOB '*{name_pattern}*';
  ```

## Analytical Workflow (Standard Operating Procedure)

To ensure accuracy and efficiency, follow these steps:

1. **Execution Mode Selection (Pre-flight)**: Before running any
   query, determine the size of the trace file using relevant
   commands like `stat`, `ls -lh` depending on the target platform.

   | File size  | Mode           | Action                                                                                                                                                                                   |
      |------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **< 1 GB** | **Standalone** | Use `trace_processor query TRACE_FILE "..."` for every query in the steps below. No further setup needed.                                                                                |
   | **≥ 1 GB** | **RPC**        | Start the HTTP server now (see Long-running mode section) before proceeding. Drive all queries in the steps below through the Python client. Do not call `trace_processor query` at all. |

   > **Why:** Reparsing a multi-GB trace on every query costs tens of
   > seconds of latency per call. The RPC server parses once and holds
   > the trace in memory across all subsequent queries. For traces under
   > 1 GB, the standalone one-shot form is fast enough and simpler —
   > prefer it.

   If **RPC mode** is selected, start the server now and confirm it is live with:
   `curl -sIf -m 1 http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/status`. Then proceed to Step 2.
2. **Precedence Rule:** If the user's request contains a SQL query,
   use it **without modification** and skip to step 4 for validation.
3. **Research & Dissection:** Identify the core question and required data
   points.
4. **Mandatory Schema Validation:** Locate relevant tables via
   `__intrinsic_stdlib_tables`. Verify column names and types. Do not
   guess schemas or rely on your internal knowledge. You must use the
   guidelines detailed in this skill to discover relevant views,
   tables or modules based on the problem domain and high-level
   intents (for example, 'CPU time', 'running time', 'overlap', 'jank').
   - **Why:** Searching solely for exact table names misses
     comprehensive, pre-computed views built for these analyses.
   - **Intent Check:** You must verify if a stdlib module already provides
   the needed abstraction before drafting manual arithmetic or custom joins.
  - **IMPORTANT:** If your query requires calculating overlaps,
   intersections, or boundaries between intervals, you MUST search the
   `__intrinsic_*` tables globally (for example, `GLOB 'overlap*'`) before
    writing `MIN()/MAX()` or `IIF(dur = -1...)` logic.
5. **Draft & Validate Loop (Max 3 Iterations):**
  - [ ] **Draft:** Use only verified schemas. Ensure `INCLUDE PERFETTO
    MODULE` is present for non-prelude modules.
  - [ ] **Verify Idempotency:** Use `CREATE OR REPLACE` or `DROP TABLE IF
    EXISTS` for virtual tables.
  - [ ] **Check Precision:** Are ALL columns prefixed with aliases (e.g.,
    `s.name`)? Are you joining on `utid`/`upid`?
  - [ ] **String Matching:** Did you use `GLOB` or `=` instead of `LIKE`?
  - [ ] **Span Join Check:** If using `SPAN_JOIN`, are tables `PARTITIONED`
    and materialized?
  - [ ] **Execute:** Run the query using the execution mode selected
    in Step 1.

   **Execution Rules:**
  - **File Usage:** If you must create a SQL file to execute queries (for
    example, due to query length or escaping issues), you must create them
    in the `/tmp/` directory.
  - **Failure Resilience:** Debug and fix SQL syntax and logic errors when
    query fails. Don't simplify the analytical intent to pass validation.
    For example, if requested to calculate an overlap or intersection, you
    must fix the intersection math. Don't substitute with disjoint queries
    (for example, returning independent total durations) as a workaround.
6. **Cleanup & Finalize:**
  - Explicitly return and state the final validated SQL and explain the
    results to the user.
  - Before finishing, delete any temporary SQL files created in `/tmp/`.
  - Ensure you have killed the $SERVER_PID before exiting.
