# Querying Perfetto traces

This skill teaches you how to extract data from a Perfetto trace file
(`.pftrace`, `.perfetto-trace`, `.pb`) using `trace_processor` and
PerfettoSQL.

The `trace_processor` binary is the foundation for all Perfetto analysis.
Reference docs: <https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/trace-processor>.

## Guidelines and Hints

- **Idempotency:** Ensure queries are idempotent to prevent "already exists" errors during multiple executions.
  - For Perfetto objects, always use `CREATE OR REPLACE`: `CREATE OR REPLACE PERFETTO TABLE`, `CREATE OR REPLACE PERFETTO VIEW`, `CREATE OR REPLACE PERFETTO FUNCTION`, `CREATE OR REPLACE PERFETTO MACRO`.
  - For SQLite Virtual Tables (such as `SPAN_JOIN`), `CREATE OR REPLACE` is not supported. Explicitly drop them first: `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS my_table; CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE my_table USING SPAN_JOIN(...);`
  - For standard SQLite indexes, prepend `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS index_name;`.
- **`SPAN_JOIN` safety:** `SPAN_JOIN` will crash if intervals **within the same input table** overlap. Always use the `PARTITIONED {column}` (for example, `PARTITIONED upid`) clause to isolate intervals.
- **Materialization:** Intermediate tables fed into a `SPAN_JOIN` must be materialized using `CREATE PERFETTO TABLE`, not `CREATE VIEW`.
- **Trace Boundaries (`dur = -1`):** Slices or thread states that don't finish before the trace ends are recorded with `dur = -1`. When calculating a bounding box (for example, `ts + dur`) or summing durations (`SUM(dur)`), handle incomplete durations using: `IIF(dur = -1, trace_end() - ts, dur)`.
- **Robust State Transitions:** Avoid manual timestamp arithmetic (for example, `ts + dur = next.ts`) to join adjacent events. Rely on standard library modules (for example, `sched.runnable`, `linux.perf.counters`, `intervals.overlap`) which safely handle trace gaps and preemptions.
- **Unique Identifiers:** When writing SQL queries in Perfetto, you must join tables using `utid` (unique thread ID) or `upid` (unique process ID) instead of the regular `tid` or `pid`. **Why it's useful**: The operating system recycles `TIDs` and `PIDs`, while `UTIDs` and `UPIDs` remain unique for the lifetime of the trace, which prevents incorrect joins.
- **Safe Argument Extraction:** Use `EXTRACT_ARG(arg_set_id, 'key')` to extract dictionary or JSON-like properties from slices or tracks. Don't attempt string parsing.
- **String Matching (Always use GLOB):** Use `GLOB` instead of `LIKE`. `LIKE` causes performance bottlenecks and treats underscores (`_`) as wildcards, leading to bugs.
  - **Exact matches:** Use `=`.
  - **Substring matches:** Use `GLOB` with `*` (for example, `name GLOB '*RenderThread*'`).
  - **Case-insensitive matches:** Use `LOWER(name) GLOB` and make sure the search string is fully lowercase (for example, `LOWER(name) GLOB '*renderthread*'`). Use this when dealing with inconsistent trace capitalization.
- **Calculating Time Overlaps:** To calculate the overlap duration between two time intervals `[start1, end1]` and `[start2, end2]`:
  > **Precedence Rule:** Always prefer using `SPAN_JOIN` or standard library functions (for example, `intervals.overlap`) to calculate overlaps **between two different sets of intervals**. Avoid manual arithmetic if a standard library feature or `SPAN_JOIN` can achieve the same result. Use the following logic if no built-in alternative exists.
  1. **Condition:** The intervals overlap if `start1 < end2` and `start2 < end1`.
  2. **Duration:** The overlap duration is calculated as `MIN(end1, end2) - MAX(start1, start2)`
     > **Important:** Incomplete Perfetto slices have a duration of -1 (`dur = -1`). Always calculate the effective end time using `ts + IIF(dur = -1, trace_end() - ts, dur)` before applying this logic.
- **App Startups:** Query `android_thread_slices_for_all_startups` for app startup requests.
- **Counters:** Join `counter_track` with `counter` to get values of counter with a specific name.
- **CPU Frequency:** When querying for a CPU frequency counter, include the `linux.cpu.frequency` module and use the `cpu_frequency_counters` table.
- **Time Windows:** When looking for events around a specific timestamp, start with 100ms as the window size.
- **Alias Check:** Always prefix column names with table or view alias, that is: `{alias}.{column_name}`.
- **Total Time Calculation:** To calculate the total time spent in slices matching a specific name pattern (for example, `*{name_pattern}*`), you must sum their durations. **Why it's useful**: This helps quantify the total impact of a specific function or feature on performance across multiple calls.
  ```sql
  SELECT count(*) as total_count, 
         sum(IIF(slice.dur = -1, trace_end() - slice.ts, slice.dur)) / 1000000.0 as total_dur_ms 
  FROM slice WHERE slice.name GLOB '*{name_pattern}*';
  ```

## Resources

- **Documentation:** The Perfetto Standard Library documentation is in [`references/perfetto-stdlib.md`](references/perfetto-stdlib.md). Use this file as a reference to discover available modules, find schemas (columns and types) for specific tables or views, or determine the `INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE` statements required before drafting SQL query.
- **Execution Tool:** Queries are executed using the official `trace_processor` wrapper script downloaded directly from Perfetto. Output is returned in pure CSV format.

## Execution Protocol

You must follow these steps sequentially, mirroring a multi-agent pipeline:

### Step 0: Tool Setup

**Fetch the Wrapper:** If you don't have `trace_processor` in your current working directory or in your path, download it directly from the Perfetto index:
`curl -LO https://get.perfetto.dev/trace_processor && chmod +x ./trace_processor`
> **Important:** The file served at this URL is a `~10KB` Python wrapper script. Don't assume the download failed because it is human-readable text. This is the intended behavior. This script handles lazy-loading the real binary into `~/.local/share/perfetto/` on its first run. Use it directly.

### Step 1: Dissection and Schema Research

1. Identify the core question, required data points, and filtering conditions.
2. **Precedence Rule:** If the user's request contains a SQL query, use it **without modification** and skip to Step 2 for validation.
3. **Mandatory Schema and Module Search:** For every table or view you plan to use, you MUST find its schema in [`references/perfetto-stdlib.md`](references/perfetto-stdlib.md). **Don't read the entire documentation file** --- it consumes the context window. Follow this precise workflow:
   - **Discovery and Search:** Use available search tools (`grep`, `read_file` or file search) with line limits to discover relevant views, tables or modules based on your problem domain and high-level intents (for example, 'CPU time', 'running time', 'overlap', 'jank').
     - **Why:** Searching solely for exact table names misses comprehensive, pre-computed views built for these analyses.
     - **Note:** You must verify if a Standard Library module already provides the needed abstraction before drafting manual arithmetic or custom functions.
   - **Targeted Bounded Reads:** Once you identify the relevant modules, efficiently read the tables and views within that module section.
   - **Extract:** Extract only the schema, columns, and the exact `INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE` statements for the required object from the documentation.
   - **Verify:** Review the columns, types, and descriptions to ensure the table matches your needs.
4. Print the research results before drafting the query: `Schema for {name}:` listing columns and types.

### Step 2: Draft and Validate Loop (Max 3 Iterations)

Draft the SQL query in SQLite syntax using **only** the schemas retrieved in Step 1. After drafting, you must validate against this checklist:
- [ ] **SQLite Syntax:** Does the query parse successfully without syntax errors?
- [ ] **Idempotency:** Are all object creations safe to re-run? (Did you use `CREATE OR REPLACE PERFETTO` and `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` for virtual tables?)
- [ ] **Existence:** Were all tables found in the documentation?
- [ ] **Intent Check:** Is there a pre-existing standard library table or view that will fulfill this intent before instead of writing manual arithmetic?
- [ ] **Column Accuracy:** Do columns match the retrieved schemas?
- [ ] **Alias Check:** Are ALL column names prefixed with their table or view alias (for example, `alias.column_name`)?
- [ ] **Module Check:** Are `INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE` statements included for all non-prelude modules? **You must use the exact module names provided in the documentation.**
- [ ] **Span Join Check:** If using `SPAN_JOIN`, are tables safely `PARTITIONED` to prevent overlapping interval crashes? Are intermediate tables materialized with `CREATE PERFETTO TABLE`?
- [ ] **No LIKE Constraint:** Did you map string matches using `GLOB` or `=` instead of prohibited `LIKE`?
- [ ] **Execution Check:** You MUST run queries using the standalone `./trace_processor` wrapper with the `--query-string` flag: `./trace_processor --query-string "QUERY" {trace_file}`.

**Execution Rules:**
- **File Usage**: If you must create a SQL file to execute queries (for example, due to query length or escaping issues), you must create them in the `/tmp/` directory.
- **State**: The execution is purely ephemeral. Database state does not persist across turns. You **cannot** share state (like views or tables) across queries in different turns. Every query must be standalone and fully self-contained.
- **Failure Resilience**: Debug and fix SQL syntax and logic errors when query fails. Don't simplify the analytical intent to pass validation. For example, if requested to calculate an overlap or intersection, you must fix the intersection math. Don't substitute with disjoint queries (for example, returning independent total durations) as a workaround.

### Step 3: Final Output

1. Explicitly return and state the final validated SQL and explain the results to the user.
2. Before finishing your response, delete all temporary SQL files you created in `/tmp/` directory.

## Invocation Modes

### Quickstart (Single Query)
To run a single query and exit:
```sh
./trace_processor --query-string "SELECT ts, dur FROM slice LIMIT 10" TRACE_FILE
```

### Long-running mode (Preferred for iteration)
Reparsing a trace is slow. Use the shell once as an HTTP RPC server:
```sh
# Start the server on a random port to avoid collisions
PORT=$((9100 + RANDOM % 900))
./trace_processor server http --port $PORT TRACE_FILE
```
Connect from Python (use `127.0.0.1:PORT`, not `localhost`):
```python
from perfetto.trace_processor import TraceProcessor
tp = TraceProcessor(addr='127.0.0.1:PORT')
for row in tp.query('SELECT ts, dur, name FROM slice LIMIT 5'):
    print(row.dur, row.name)
# Pandas support if dependency is installed:
df = tp.query('SELECT ts, dur, name FROM slice LIMIT 100').as_pandas_dataframe()
tp.close()
```

## Discovery Tools (Intrinsic)

Use these to find what's available when the documentation is insufficient:
```sql
-- 1. List every stdlib module currently available.
SELECT package, module FROM __intrinsic_stdlib_modules ORDER BY 1, 2;
-- 2. List the tables/views a specific module exposes (after INCLUDE).
SELECT name, type, description FROM __intrinsic_stdlib_tables('slices.with_context');
-- 3. Read the column schema of any table/view.
SELECT * FROM slice LIMIT 0;
```
